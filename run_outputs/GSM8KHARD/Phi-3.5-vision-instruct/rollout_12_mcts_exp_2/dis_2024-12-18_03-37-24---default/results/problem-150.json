Since Jane was also asked about entire sweets quantity but only provided with individual counts without their amounts lets use available data assuming equal distribution ratio between both sugars types therefore estimated Apple count could be calculated using proportionality principle via following expression [apple_count]  \u2248 [(total_choco - ((cocoa*weight)/(basket_size)) ]/(average_apple / average_appleWeight).
