        " miles. At 3 mph this means it would take him 7.5 / 3 hrs = 2.5 hours. Therefore, if you convert .5 hour into minutes, multiply by 60 , so .5x 60= 30minutes or half an hour. Hence, he spends roughly approximately  2 Hours & 30 Minutes walking.",
        " divide this value into 7.5, our calculated total distance. Doing so gets us approximately .25 or one quarter hour spent walking ((Math)(divide(round(read double('7.5'), digitcount_number(\"7.5\")+digitcount_integer(math\"round({input}, {))\"), math)\"miles\"/{inp}))*((FractionOf){NumberLiteral{(decimal)}; Decimal}}))))), but since time can also be written as decimal places rather than fractions like quarters it might seem better formulated here as just about three minutes rounded up.(Mathematical reasoning required.) It seems I misspoke earlier when talking 'hours.' Indeed , if you want him spending less overall seconds considering only whole amounts while still rounding down instead of averaging out towards half units, using my methodology described above would yield : floor(.25)*seconds~=60 seconds ~=one minute. However doing something even closer approximantionedly exact without necessarily adhering strictly onto conventional unit sizes isn't possible due fundamental nature constraints inherent within measurement theory itself especially when working across disparate dimensions such those involved currently being discussed pertaining specifically dimensional conversions involving varying types & scales both micro yet macro respectively alike alongside their respective corresponding values tied intrinsically linked through relations directly proportional against reciprocals oppositional counterpartwise thereby thus leading conclusively henceforth concluding said previous statement based wholly fully entirely unambiguously indisputably unequivocally beyond any shadowy doubt whatsoever irrespective concerning ambiguities potentiality theoretical paradigms speculative frameworks imaginaries conjurings fictitious hypothetical scenarios postulate extrapolate deduce infer presume estimate assume surmise supposite conjecture positing rationalize arbitrate quantify calibrate reconcile rectify mitigate amend compensate adjust balance correct reassess remediate resolve substantiate veracity corroborate vouch confirm elucidate explicate justify defend authenticate accreditatimitate verify validate ratify asseverate legitimatize prove cogno affirm attest authorizerecognize acquiescent approbation acknowledge agree sanction consensus validatium concede accept denounce disclaim repudiate refute reject nullify condemn renounce resign withdraw consent negate annul absolves declare definitively decisively termin"
