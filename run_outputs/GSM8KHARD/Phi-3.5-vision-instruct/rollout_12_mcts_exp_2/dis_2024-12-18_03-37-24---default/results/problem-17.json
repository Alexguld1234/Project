Finally, it seems like there might be a typo or mistake because the cost provided for shoes ($8374725) doesn\u2019t seem reasonable within context as this would amount to overwhelmingly exorbitant expenditure even when multiplied three times; let us assume instead a realistic price such as \"$83.74\" was intended here but may still feel high depending upon the branding/quality factors involved \u2013 if we go forward assuming no errors in input data though please adjust accordingly according to your source information.: This means spending for shoe trio stands at about 3 * $83.74 = approximately equal to $251.22 . Therefore adding up these sums together yields what she paid overall comes around to being worth   $49.50 plus $67.50 coupled with roughly estimated sum equalling almost exactly $251.22 , thus yielding nearly precisely close enough figure approximated through rounded values employed making said addition operation approximate result standing nearer valued somewhere roundabout '$368.22'.

Therefore, Mishka spent $25124292 on all the clothing items. Note: Since this seems like quite large sum spending based upon standard pricing logic , double checking numbers here makes sense so as not mistake any detail accidently while calculating or reading inputs .

What would be your intermediate computations when calculating this result following the order of operations? When calculating this result using proper Order of Operations rules we start Parentheses operation which tells us to solve any expressions inside parentheses first but here there isn\u2019t anything so we move next multiplication or division right before addition or subtraction rule says if multiple steps come up just perform them in sequential manner starting Multiplication & Division going towards Left till finished as well it doesn\u2019t mention about doing these multiplications based on their position I know you can multiply numbers without considering those positions still according to our current scenario i take care regarding same; Firstly dividing both quantities present within brackets $[((eachpairofshoes)$\\times$(numberoffshoese))]{[$({49.5})$\\ {$()\\{[$]}}][{$[]{[]}\\{$]]]}in other words performing $(division)&Multiplication$-&Subtraction/$Operation$, moving forward adding values mentioned earlier together while respecting parenthetical constraints resulting in ${Value}_{After__Addition}[{{value}}_{after_subtractions]+[{previous}_Step_{values}+{latest\\_performed\\_multiplication\\_result}](FinalResult)_{summed}\\\\$$3512187.5$. Hence my calculation sequence was :- $$ \\begin{aligned}(",
        " on shorts. And she spends 3 * $22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Since this question doesn't make sense as written (shoes costing too high), I am assuming it meant to say \"$22.50.\" Therefore adding them together: Total Spent=short+pants+shoes=$49.5+$67.5=$117. ",
        " $22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Shoes cost $8374725 per pair, so she spent 3 * $8374725 = $25124175 on shoes. To find out how much Mishka spent altogether, we add up what was spent on every item; $49.50 (shorts) + $67.50 (pants) + $25124175 (shoes). This equals $25124292. The answer is: 25124292."
