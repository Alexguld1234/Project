Well done!! You nailed the calculation! However, double check whether our assumption regarding splitting time proportionately based solely on their respective speeds stands true when actually compared against typical exercise duration recommendations like cycling versus powerwalking intervals typically observed among athletes who engage consistently over longer durations such perhaps during triathlons competitions marathons races olympic events international championships...and several other disciplines worldwide sports including professional gaming leagues online streaming esports platforms..

        " activity within the six hours period since one third is spent running and two thirds walking. One third for running means 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours spent running; hence she covers 4 mph * 2 hrs = 8 miles during this time frame. Two-thirds equates to approximately 4 hours walking; thus resulting into covering roughly 4 mph * 4 hrs = 16 miles while walking around. Summing up both distances provides us with their combined distance which equals 8+16=24 miles covered altogether throughout these six continuous periods.

As Dana walks twice slower than runs : Walking Speed=running_speed/2 so it becomes  2 mile Per Hour , To know about Total Time Spent By her WALKING Twice lesser percentage which signifies(Total time spent )*twothird% or [(total_time)*(2/3)]which results into   6*(2/3)= Four Hours And during this period since i already knwo she takes minimum duration hence she manages covering maximum possible area thereforeWalking_Distance =Speed\u00d7Time;walking_miles=(2)(4);Hence Walker s Area Covered Equals (Less Than Half An Hour);In summing up Both Mileage Totalled ; Summed_Motionly_Areal_Covered EQUAL TO RUNNING+WALKING=[Final result]= [RUNNING MOTIONLY ADDED WITH FINALLY TAKEN FROM THE NEXT MOVES] Therefore Finalresult comes upto 12 milestimes ",
        " the time which equals about 2 hours. Walking covers two-thirds or approximately 4 hours. Finally, multiply respective speeds by their corresponding durations. Running yields 4 mph \u00d7 2 hrs = 8 miles; walking results into zero since no walking speed was provided(the problem seems incomplete here). Thus, within those conditions considering available information only, Dana could cover eight miles while maintaining consistent paces during both activities. Hence,\"Incomplete Problem Data.\"   ",
        " (2/3)*6 = 4 hours. To determine distance traveled during these activities, multiply their respective speeds by time spent moving. Rushing covers a total of 4*2=8 miles and while walks cover another 4*(3)=12 miles adding both distances together comes out to 8+12=<<8+12=20>>20 miles covered over all duration which includes rushes , jogs and strolls .
