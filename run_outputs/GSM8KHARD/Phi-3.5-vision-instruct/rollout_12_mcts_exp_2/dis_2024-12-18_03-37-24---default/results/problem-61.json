        " rose has 8 thorns. To find out how many thorns altogether... First calculate the roses which would be 13,904,090 rose bushes multiplied by 25 equals 347,602,250 roses. Second we want only this multiplication times all of their own 8 thorns so let us multiply these together.. This calculation says you take the above result (i.e., amount of flowers) and multiple it again but instead use its second digit ('2'), making your calculations thus :  347,602,250*8 or finally; our very last arithmetic operation states if I put my fingers up and divide them according into groups containing eight items each -- approximately seventy seven thousand million four hundred twenty one point six ones ... My hand counts roughly sixty three billion fifty two millions forty sevens thousands .. That represents exactly what was intended through this particular prompt ; otherwise known as 'the right way'. And while doing such can seem cumbersome at first glance because nothing appears simple here \u2013 don\u2019t fret about going off track either since mathematics requires precision rather than guessing wildly! We shouldn't just sit back casually assume someone else understand every single term within equations without breaking down steps furthermore verifying terms thoroughly before moving forward next time maybe try explaining something easier perhaps breakdown even basic math concepts themselves like addition / subtraction etcetera .

Then multiply this resultant quantity by the average no of thorns every single one (roses). i.e.,   347,602,250 \u00d7 8 =  2,780,818,000 . The answer is : 2,780,818,000.",
        " out the total number of thorns we first multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush which yields 13,904,090 times 25 equals 347,602,250 Roses; these all collectively possessing 8 thorns would yield us (assuming no repetition) 347,602,250 multiplied by eight results as 2,780,818,000 Thorns altogether! However if any Rose was repeated i.e it bloomed twice or thrice than just double(or triple), etc., such replication wouldn\u2019t affect our count since this counts every single unique instance only once.(i.e No duplicated counting). Thus ,the accurate threshold stays unmoved. Hence here concluded conclusion remains consistent : Total Number Of **Unique** 'Thorn Countings' Is Equal TO \ud835\udc47=347,602,250 \u00d7 \u210e+8 .

        " to calculate the total amount of roses which would be 13,904,090 multiplied by 25 equals 347,602,250. This multiplication was computed because every single rose flower grows out of one rose shrub or tree hence it makes sense to start off our calculations using this base fact. Next up since all flowers possess leaves but not necessarily stem hairiness like trichomes here come into picture especially as part/percentage ratio towards whole leaf area(assuming you may ask). Since these small bristles known commonly referred upon internet search engines across worldwide platforms tend mostly reside either within phloem cells\u2019 cell walls making them easily removable without significant damage when plucking downy stems; so what better than adding additional numerical data points before reaching conclusive statements based solely physical observations alone!

And once again \u2013 don\u2019t forget those lovely tiny spikettes called 'thorns'.
