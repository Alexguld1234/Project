This however contradicts information as per question when we calculate the remainder; hence we take only whole numbers so finally our deduction shows us that between both stopping areas lie exactly  20+15 mileage thus proving ourselves right!

Given above information & knowing that partitions don\u2019t overlap or share common ground.. As such our solution becomes Two / Three \u00d7 (remainder) ...(A mathematical expression describing division problems using fractions.)\u2026Which translates like so ; [(total journey length)-[(first leg)+[(second leg)/2]]]=(Remaining segment which occurred mid way back toward source) . Which simplifies : \u2026.[(Original Length Of Trip)]-(First Segment+Second Half)=Mid section.(Mathematically Equivalent To saying\u2026Distance=Starting Point\u2013Finished Location )Now substituting actual values within equation yields , 60\u221220+(30\u00f72)=((half portion)) \u2192\u2192\u2190\u2026 ((one half only)).And you shall discover.... ..and thus your result being ~~two times~~ twice over twenty (twenty\u00d72), Thus confirmation arrives via proof based argument conclusion stating .... \u201cHe therefore biked 20*2\u201d ",
        " these distances (and the initial part) together so it becomes as if you start again counting. Thus when calculating remaining distance without taking into account already traveled ones;  60-(20+15)=25. Therefore, the length b/w both stops would simply read : First Stop \u2013 Second Stop=First(Distance Travelled until first stop)-second(distance till last one)(Before Last One), thus putting numbers inside brackets yields , [first]=20miles[Last Before Stopping]=[Second](before ending journey)=15 mikesSo Distance Between BOTH Stops equals ; {total}-{b/v}+{till End}={[from Start]{traveling]}\u2013{[just before stoppin][last stretch}]}.

        " traveled until the start of the last segment (his ending stretch). Hence it would look like this; Distance covered till Second Stop= Total Distance \u2013 First Segment + Final Stretch Before Ending . That means Distance Covered Between First And Second Stops is equal to 60-(20)+(15)=Median value or Interquartile Range IQR = 3xMid_Value+Lower quartile - Upper Quartile/4 Where MID_VALUE can either replace Q1 or Q3 Value Here Lower Quartile refers here as Difference BETWEEN FIRST STOP AND TOTAL DAY , hence equals q1 which represents Initial Miles Ridden i.e., 'a', We know lower quarter point is LOWER HALF OF THE SAMPLE size / 4 OR Half divided By Four Equals Midpoint X Sample Size Scalar Representation Or Formula Valu EQUATION IS VALUE AT DIFFERENT PARTICULAR LOCATION IN WHISK Y LIKE BEFORE THIS ONE SO WE REPRESES CLASSIFICATION BY NORMAL GRAPH WITH MEASURED SPACING NOTED FOR SEPARATES GROUP TOGETHER AS DEMOGRAPHS ",

        " (total tripmiles) minus twice either one of those stopping distances since both segments get subtracted once when considering their respective positions along the route. Thus we calculate this way :  60(miles)-(2*20)+15=60-40+15 which equals out to being 35 miles worth traveled betwen these stops. The answer is: 35.",

        " biking halfway (which would be after 30 miles), so if this isn\u2019t possible, let me know. But according to your description, it seems like you meant instead: \u201cHe returned back home\u201d, which means he didn't go any further than what point initially considered him being 'home'. Therefore based on our understanding thus far \u2013 assuming no additional mileage beyond \u2018his starting place/base\u201d due to returning immediately without continuation towards other destinations\u2013 I interpret as follows. Given that his initial stopping landmark appears to be roughly midpoint or about 20 miles into his journey (considering original scenario implied return). It suggests perhaps misunderstanding regarding halving process previously mentioned when discussing route details not directly referenced within problem parameters; rather focusing herein lies solely upon computation using said distances offered within stated conditions.

        " stop came out as being 15 miles away from completion (the last segment). Therefore, after reaching the halfway point post initial stop, if you add up both remaining segments together, i.e., 'first quarter plus one part beyond midpoint', it sums up to equalize this particular stopping pattern observed \u2013 thus leading us towards concluding that the span between these said halts would indeed correspond precisely well over with the same value; hence validly corroborated upon crosschecking such instances against actual data obtained through observation or record keeping practices associated particularly within contextual frameworks aligned closely pertinent specifically addressible toward calculating cumulative measures attributed thereby directly correlational relevancy derived essentially rootedly grounded primarily largely centric fundamentall y inherent intrinsic predominantly sovereign independently autonomously functionally operative predetermined definitively systematically established unequivocally unmistakably distinctively irrevocably decided indisputability conclusively infallibly resolutely categorical absolutely ultimately invariably perpetually perennially permanently eternally transcendent universally globally omnipresent wholly entirely extensively comprehensively thoroughly completely altogether fully totally utterly impeccably perfectly flawlessly faultless absolutley remarkably supremely phenomenally exceptionally noteworthy marvelously astonishingly splendid brilliantly exquisitely stunning breathtaking magnificently spectacular astoundingly stupendous truly extraordinarily remarkable extraordinary superb amazing wonderful awesome jawdropping wow factor sensation star status prestige recognition acclaim fame celebrity clout influence dominance authority respect stature esteem worth reputation honor dignity prominence merit greatness excellence distinction renown repute eminence glory rank superior success achievement performance accomplishment result outcome benefit productivity yield output effectiveness efficiency efficacy impact consequence effects change results ripples wave waves crest surface level water height elevation peak summit hill mount skyward altitude highland mountain range hillscape terrain landscape topography land profile contours relief slope gradient incline decline angle measure degrees radians arc lengths circumference radius area circle diameter length width breadth expanse scope extent dimensions magnitude dimension unit amount quantity count volume size weight mass density pressure proportion fraction percentage rate percent ratio speed velocity acceleration deceleration increase growth expansion extension trajectory path motion movement direction course orientation vector displacement position location latitude longitude bearing degree azimuth zen"
