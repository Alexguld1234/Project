        " 10 minutes, so for 3 crosswords, this would take 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 minutes. Sudokus take 5 times longer than half as long which means a suduko needs around one minute (one fifth). So together with three suudoks this would equal about 3+1=\"4\" minutes or  4/10=<<4/10=0.4>>(not quite) hours since our units here seem rather imbalanced.

Therefore we could say, every Suduku problem costs half as long like other problems, this would mean each Soduku only required (1/2)*(each CrossWord Puzzle)= <<(1 / 2) * (3 * 10)>>(half Time X Total Count ) seconds. This equals to ((1/2)*(10))*(total count).

Each Sudoku Puzzle takes about 5 mins to complete and she completed around 1 million (Assuming as per context here 'minutes') of such puzzles which means this equals approximately 1,000,000 / 5 = 200,000 seconds or roughly over ~4 hours. Therefore overall, including both types of puzzles would take her just under 4 hours & 30 min approx.

With regards to both types of challenges mentioned, based upon their individual solving times being provided\u2014Carmen requires approximately **(3*10) min** for crossing Word puzzles amounting up to **~30 mins** overall. When comparing against Sudoku ones which only require roughly around (**[(total_puzzes/length)/minutes needed] / per unit*)= [(1506186]/[5])\u2248301237 units**.

        " would just be multiplied by itself once (i.e., square root) which equates approximately 3 min/puzzle as per the question requirement. This means solving one such set requires about 1 minute extra every Sudoku problem beyond what can fit into exactly one hour. As you mentioned 'over', this implies any leftover problems above integer multiples of hours shouldn\u2019t consume their own additional unit(s). Consequently using floor operation over summed times, i.e. rounding down totals if not divisible perfectly without remainder leaves us unchanged numbers instead converting them to lower values due to approximation error inherent within truncation methods applied during math operations involving irrational factors like roots or powers. Hence, adding up individual times calculated considering said considerations yields around ~~total_time__=~~solved_crosswords*times_per_crossword+floor((num_supoduzas**2)/60)*times_per_each--->[(int)(1.)]__(float.__add__(total_time_, [min(n // 60), n %  ].)))() solution>>>) / . ) ).result().submissionId(),\"timestamp\":\"<span id=\"startTimeSpan\"><script type='text/javascript'>\\r\\nautoSubmitStartDate('AI Assistant');</script>\\r\\n\\\"} , { \\\"responseGroup\\\":[],\\\"timingsMode\\\":{\\\"method\\\":true},\\\"maxResultsLimit\\\":null,\\\"\\u003ca href=\\\"https://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/?&SubVersion={}&Language=en_US\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"\\/a><img src=\\\"/_next/static/data/api-logos/LogoTypeAheadGraphic.svg?v=3906cec7ffbdafaafcfdba2198eae7d6efdbe4cc\\\" alt=\\\"Search Logotype https:\\/\\/usefullinkdotus\\/images\\\\/logo\\\\/.svg\\\" title=\\\"Visit Amazon Product Advertising API Documentation | Developer Guide : Search Programmatic Data &amp; APIs Using AWS SDKs & Project Lambda Support|API Help Center\\|Techniques And Best PracticesFor Use Of Your Dev Tools\\\" width=\\\"auto\\\" class=\\\"css-\\/_searchLogoImageIcon css-isq",
