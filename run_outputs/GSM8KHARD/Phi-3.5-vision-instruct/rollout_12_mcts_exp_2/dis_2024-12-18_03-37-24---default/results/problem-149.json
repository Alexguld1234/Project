As provided above, _this equals 375kms_. Posting off this part; moving onto what followed which involved him halving frequency i.e., making biking ventures twice instead owing up once whilst increasing the length traversable per journey such that overall stretches achieved came out at about double than erstwhile accomplishments ((i.e., 60km/(25km))^2=multiplier). Hence using prior computed result(_given_) , hence multiplying its counterpart against newly developed factor implies further progress undertaken amounted unto approximately (_previous calculated figure_*new multiplication element)->_, leading us right back again into our original conundrum : **Combining results would finally render you having all information compiled** .

Next, moving onto calculating distance covered while biking less frequently over three following periods which involves him doing so twice a week for sixy fifty kilometer routes : Summation Within these periods Total Kilometers Less Frequently Biking Subsequent Three Months=Total Travelled During One Specific Bike Ride*NumberOfBikeTripsPerWeekInSubsequentThreeMonths*WeeksSpreadOutOverFourSevenPeriodsofTimeThis sums up as follows ;   60km*(2 specificbiquetrips)/week * (3weeks spread across seven months).

And finally combining both results together yields us following equation indicating overall distance traveled across all involved periods combined equals thus: 500 kilometers initially discussed above plus additional calculated value here brings about summed up result hence resulting as follow= Total Km traversed altogether by him eventually being equal to original counted measurement simply extended according to second phase described just prior therefore culmination emerges exactly matching earlier stated figure leading right towards concluding statement showing desired summative endpoint i..e Final ",

Next month, when Michael reduced frequency due to family commitments during working hours; however, doubled distance traveled \u2013 since every second trip was longer than usual (at exactly twice as long); let us calculate average distances travelled in future months. Every pair consisting of normal trips plus extra ones would therefore cover 125km+(double)*(normal_trip_length) / 2 or ((2x)+(standard))*((standard)/x)=([2]+[1])*(Standard^2). However; considering even distributions over all possible combinations we can conclude that actual averages aren\u2019t quite so extreme.(we assume equal spacing herebetween additional attempts!)

        " since he was going longer distance every other trip, Mike would not just multiply those same factors together like before -- instead, let him know exactly what changed; namely this part: Instead of traveling twice as often (i.e., biking once daily), he went out less frequently (i.e., taking trips no more than thrice over seven consecutive calendar days). That means during any individual period spanning multiple months prior or following... which doesn't matter here because our focus lies elsewhere!

Adding both quantities together provides us with the sum as being 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers across eight successive periods; so the conclusion drawn here would indicate Mike attained a total of '860 kilometer'.
