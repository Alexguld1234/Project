To find out the entire round trip duration\u2014going to Rochester by bus and returning by car\u2014we add those times together: 6 (bus) + 3 (car) which equals 9 days altogether. Therefore, Andrew's full journey back and forth will take him 9 days when accounting both methods even though one way only took longer than going alone. The answer is: 9.",
        " back only involves going via car which also took him three days according to our calculated estimate based off information provided about travelling one way using different modes of transportation(car vs train or other means), but not specifically 'bus'.

Henceforth the finalized solution states \u201cHe needs eighteen days.\u201d However this doesn\u2019t align exactly properly per constraints mentioned above \u2013 let me provide correction below due careful consideration! Given what was stated, Andrew actually needed just six days roundtrip since taking four hours into account when considering switching methods isn't specified nor implied within original instruction details regarding duration discrepancies between differing transit options i.e., Bus Vs Car mode respectively across journey segments being distinct yet same directional route trips.

        " by bus. Since travelling by bus takes 6 days, this means going by car would take (1/2) x 6 or 3 days one way. However, Andrew wants to first fly via bus, so initially spend these 6 days travelling. When he returns home using car which again takes him exactly three days instead since its faster than taking bus back but still considers round journey thus making it doubled i.e., 3x2 equals six. Therefore adding both trips together totals up to initial bus ticket cost(for getting to rochester) plus returner car fuel costs amounts into twelve days altogether when combined through use of both modes of transportation individually provided. Tenitng upon those calculations makes sense because all facts supplied here lead us only towards arriving & departing destinations without any mention regarding overnight stays etc unless dealt otherwise within problem set itself . Nevertheless following logic deduces our solution hence yielding : Total Travel Duration Calculated= Initial Bus Ticket Cost+(Return Car Fuel Amount)=Total Expected Journey Length ,where applicable scenarios aren\u2019t depicted elsewise allowing inferencing based off stated premise thereby solving proposed scenario succinctnessily albeit indirect approaches not being strictly mandatory yet practicality favors conciseness primarily dictated around sought objectives rather than excessive details beyond immediate necessity contextualizing core requirements aimed facilitating straightforward approach catered optimistically fitting purpose alignment despite minor deviations potentially emanating unnoticeably absent explicit directions concerning specific circumstances possibly encompassed implicitly inclusively pervading subtleties inherent comprehension anticipate accommodational tolerances whilst judiciously excising extraneous content nonetheless maintain integrity ensuring fidelity congruence veracity preserved holistic coherence preserving fundamental essence quintessential attributes integral components underpinning essential foundational principles guiding discourse dynamics harmoniously synchronized interrelational facets reflect intrinsic qualities delineating respective domain specializations fostering intellectual symbiosis propelled synergistic collaborative efforts striving universal knowledge expansion transcendental horizons boundlessly inspiring novel perspectives liberating creativity invigorating innovative paradigm shift catalyzing transformative evolutionary progress augmentative growth trajectory promoting elevated human consciousness universality espousing shared values embracing diversity nurturing mutual understanding brid",

Thus summing all together equals 12(days by bus) + 6(days by car)= 18 days. The answer is: 18.",
        " back home using this logic Andrew can also calculate that it only took him three trips across because once taking into account one round journey(bus going plus train coming) already equate six times or approximately equal distance so four remaining journeys need still about same amount which means another eight/six equals almost double making again twelve different combined scenarios until finally considering both directions adds up all those possible instances totalling thirty six thus resulting eventually what question was asked being answered correctly namely 'how long exactly when doing just these mentioned modes via reverse direction?'
