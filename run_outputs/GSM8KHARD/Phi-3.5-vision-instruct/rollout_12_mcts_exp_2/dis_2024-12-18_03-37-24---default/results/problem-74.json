My apologies but I can see you might not understand what type or form your question falls under which led this miscommunication. Could you please provide clearer instructions ? It seems like we need specific context about whether it involves arithmetic problem solving (like basic operations) , reasoning tasks etc., additionally specifying parameters such as units involved etcetera could also help here .. Looking forward for clarification regarding the nature of task ! ... Actually sorry again just realized I misunderstood! Your actual assignment revolves around multiplication & subtraction operation . Firstly calculate tripled value(i.e multiply original quantity i.e 'amirs_cookies')then subtract it against doublecoryderivedcookie consumption('doubleoforiginal'). Keeping these points intact; let's try another approach.\r\rSo : `total_consumption` means summing up all unique consumptions including individual amounts alongwith their triples.(Also remember mathematics works based upon logical deductions hence precision matters). Substituting values according tothe formulas mentioned before,(remember our variables represent numerical figures): `(1)*[Amir+tripleOfAmir]=([valueForAmir]+ [valueForTripleAmount])=(4944179+ [(amountDoubleOfOriginal)-((summandTriple)*numberMultipler(-1)))]=(4944179+(1)^(-1))=-4944179.` Therefore finally calculating above equation results into `-4944179`. But keep in mind negative numbers don't make sense while discussing real world quantities unless specified otherwise generally when applied mathematical computations involving non zero base entities. However considering present scenario since no explicit indication towards negatives exists thus concluding conclusion won't include any sign indicating minus \"-\".
