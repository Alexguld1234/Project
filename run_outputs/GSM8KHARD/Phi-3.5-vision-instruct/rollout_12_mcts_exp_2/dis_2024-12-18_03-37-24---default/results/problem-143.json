        " / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher every week. With Published A being paid half as well (thus one quarter) compared to ProducerB it would mean if A was paid .05$/sentence than producer B could afford 2*.05$, or .05* 2=$$.1 so mark makes $.10+$ .05=.$ .15 every time he takes care off a Sentencwheeping producers. And since we know hertakes care of these words twenty times every week this totals out to (.15)*(20)= $ 3. Hence finally we divide our amount due into cent digits which amounts up to 300cents makinghesthematricly equivalentto$3andaswearefinshsed!THEANSWEREVERYTHETHEORY..butinrealitymarkwontbeearninganythingforthesentencesithelpshewrite!!SOUNDSTOWNMYWATCHTOGETWORKEDOUT!!!

        " Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, it would earn him 5 * 500 = 2500 cents (or 25 dollars). As stated above, Publisher B pays double which amounts to 10 cents per sentence thus making 10*500=5000 Cents or ($50)   Therefore when we add those together you get a sum of $(25+50)=$75    ",
        " he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A every week. And since Publisher B pays twice as much, this means Publisher B would also pay half their amount but double it so they stay consistent, making them effectively just another payment from mark albeit split across two people meaning Makes same again (assuming one worker) hence additional cost paid back canceled out due splitting evenly). Therefore we add up amounts made : Total earned= 2*[2500+Cost From Publishing b] Where Cost To Editing By publishingB equals all(since its halved equally among multiple employees working together ) & not affect individual salary calculation , thus leaving only income generated directly attributable towards personal efforts . Concluding further math requires details about workforce distribution amongst employers involved including potential overhead allocations related expenses if any along wage structure policies followed thereby impact upon payout dynamics influencing net gain figures obtained hereunder resulting consequent analysis might require expert domain specific knowledge bases relevant applicable regulatory framework governing said operations plus consideration various factors potentially mitigating direct profit stream such like taxation implications linked within respective jurisdiction areas pertinent operation locale contextualized alongside prevailing market conditions dictating remunerative landscape against operational metrics performance indicators assessments correlated job role responsibilities inherently entailed tasks undertaken during service delivery process underlined whilst maintaining fiduciary duties upheld stringent compliance mandate obligations ensuring corporately aligned strategic vision objectives execution alignment safeguarding stakeholder interests harmonizing holistic business growth sustainability trajectory pursuits aim converging optimal returns maximization endeavors facilitative balanced risk management apportioning equitable value creation mechanisms fairness preserving principles inclusive transparency accountability integrity enforcement fostering trust confidence engender positive organizational culture nurturing employee morale motivation enhancing productivity optimizing resource utilization efficiency efficiencies reducing costs lower operating margins increasing shareholder wealth creating long term competitive advantage shaping brand reputation positioning firm leadership differentiator innovating transformational change driving industry disruption catalyzing paradigm shift embracing future readiness navigating dynamic challenges adapting evolving trends capitalizing emergent opportunities leveraging synergies harvesting benefits amplifying enterprise prosperity realising substantial monetary worth accruals",
        " cents per sentence since it\u2019s double their payment. Thus over one month (in this case counting as four weeks) he earns 500 * 5 (for Publisher A), which amounts to 2500 monetary units or cents; likewise Publisher B makes another amounting to 500*10=5000 monetary units but those are cent not dollar so need also conversion into same unit here i.e., convert them firstly to standard numerical value such that you get these values equivalent enough before doing addition operation hence converted again back finally resultant becomes simply sum up of previously computed results meaning adding both terms just multiplying later upon obtaining individual summations only , we reach out :(((total wages)=((money earned))=(payment received)(sentences edited)), therefore resulting equals ((final salary paid within )=($1+(dollar figure expressed differently through other common denomination))) . ultimately concluding mark's accumulated remuneration reaches $(1.+)... if further precision necessitated dividing above single digit sums via division/subdivision strategy may arise subsequently accordingly! thanks:) "
