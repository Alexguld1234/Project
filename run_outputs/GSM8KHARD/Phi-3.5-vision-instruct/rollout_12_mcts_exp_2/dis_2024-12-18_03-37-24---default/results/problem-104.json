Also expecting help around calculation methods !! Cheers! :) Sorry guys don\u2019t want answers directly since people overthink sometimes rather helping them understand concepts used instead making short cut way through details itself thereby leading towards confusion further ahead once asked multiple times again asking same thing different contextual level \u2026 let us clarify our doubts via detailed discussion about steps involved involving numbers & operations applied accordingly\u2026 hope makes things little clearer than usual ;) Thanks yall always willingness sharing thoughts too helps tremendously specially such busy periods during holidays especially when folks keep stress upon completing daily tasks within limited time frame whereas work life balance becomes hard maintainable thus appreciating their efforts taking responsibility fully while prioritizing efficiently ensuring everyone gets fair share relaxation equally despite occasional mishaps occur every single year regardless timing ;-) Take care everybody stay safe enjoy yourself happily thanks alot lots already received complimentary supportive advice guidance assistance kindly providing extra hand hold services",
