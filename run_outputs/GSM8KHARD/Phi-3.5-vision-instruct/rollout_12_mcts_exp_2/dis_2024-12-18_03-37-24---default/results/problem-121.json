        " legs so if you multiply them times their amount it equals 640 which means 640*leg counts as one leg unit or just leave this part out since I don\u2019t know what exactly \u201ccounting\u201d here means \u2013 but assuming counting implies finding individual body parts like arms not limbs\u2026 And let me explain further; when humans count something (either animals/people themselves) using our fingers ,then all these extra details become irrelevant because regardless whether somebody holds up only right hand OR both hands together without distinction would still result into single digit sum being counted towards quantity . Similarly doing math requires us first add values individually before combining results later! Therefore simplifying equations helps save time while working mathematically ; however sometimes people get confused about order especially complex ones such       ...where things need grouping instead simple addition followed multiplication resulting again back totals etc..
