From here you might notice one could get further complicated because 'total pen count' doesn't necessarily convey what mathematical operation needs to occur or whether subtraction/addition ought to take place under particular circumstances not mentioned within your problem statement itself! Hence no definite numerical value appears without additional contextual information implying specific arithmetic operations relevant according their realistic application relevance outside theoretical mathematics teaching settings based purely off isolated symbols alone . It would greatly benefit any student struggling like myself who wants clear answers when learning math problems rather than ambiguous cliffhangers leaving them feeling frustrated stuck behind those pesky barricading obstacles preventing successful completion thereby limiting educational growth achievement success opportunities potential missed personal development milestones attainability limitations life progression possibilities future goals aspirations unfulfilled dream destinies hindrances challenges roadblocks stumbling block detours diversionary tactics navigational hazards impediments hurdles handicaps disadvantages encumbrances drawbacks setback backlogs delays slowdown progress pauses holds freezes blocks stops obstructions stopgap measures contingencies plans alternative routes alternatives substitutes options selections choices decisions resolution strategies coping mechanisms techniques tricks tips tools shortcuts simplifications explanations elucidations illuminations insights revelations discoveries enlightenment understandings clarity comprehensions interpretations realizations awareness heightened consciousness mind expanding cognitions broaden perspectives diverse views novel approaches transformative",
