        " slept and Harriet slept for 1 hour (given), this means if every fraction was scaled down as units of time equivalent to half minutes instead of fractions like it usually would mean, Jackie could manage these smaller portions easier without getting confused among larger numbers or denominators which might add up very quickly when dealing directly; hence allowing simpler arithmetic operations using basic addition along lines related strictly per single unit count comparison against totals found prior \u2013 no matter however intricate details may lie behind such calculation process because simple ones come first before trying all sorts complex math puzzles involved here!

Therefore, Harry rested three times better than his buddy \u201cJames\u201d. That can also imply if you convert it into minutes , since one hour contains sixty minute seconds; hence 3 hrs converted unto min is equal thirty six mins or half past twenty seven . This kind of calculations come handy when calculating differences pertaining different units like months against years.. It helps us calculate shorter span details precisely even though overall information might not explicitly show its requirement but still provide assistance without explicit indications regarding specific calculation scenarios!!!
