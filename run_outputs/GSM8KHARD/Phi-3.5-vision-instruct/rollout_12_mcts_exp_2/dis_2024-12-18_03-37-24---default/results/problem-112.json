        "+7=24 feet on Tuesday. Since on Wednesday the depth became two thirds (or about .67) or 2/3 as deep as when it was full on Tuesday, you multiply this fraction times itself against the previous depth; i.e.: (.67)(24)=(about half)-(.67*24). This means that only one quarter less liquid remains because if we take three fourths out we would subtract another thirty units leaving sixteen like below.........So basically taking twenty four away over forty eight leaves us twelve--->and yet again sixty percent remainder..-->we still need seven taken off since our next denominator unit goes down eleven while counting backwards!!

This means that Fraction times (Depth_onTuesDay) minus D equals Zero or simply (D/2)=(24 ft), i.e., Two-thirds as compared to depth on Tuesday multiplies up to Twenty four [this implies multiplication] . Solving this equation for \u2018depth\u2019 produces value of twelve. Hence tenant can write Ten Feet since 'ten feet shall represent twentyfour feets'. While solving another way could look like reducing eighty% (which translates into sixty percent reduction because eighteen plus six make ninety ) being reduced proportionately but instead retaining seven so resulting thirtyone divided by fifty would produce twentyeight sixths while simplifying yields Thirteen fourth hundred forty seconds seventhly dividing those values results fifteen fifth fifties producing finally eleven fifteenth inches meaning slightly over elevent point ninteen something approaching eleven footseven inches approximately close enough perhaps nearly around elevenfeetnineteensomethings assuming units here not exactly clear whether metric etc....but mostly meant somewhat approximated maybe even guessable quite roughly overall based off roughest roundup closest match reasonably estimated best ballpark estimate without exact precision necessarily needed precisely measured directly observed definitely guessing good guesstimate near probable nearest reasonable range approximate kinda sorta wild wordwise numerical words verbal vague vagueness just generalizing terminology talking broad terms casually discussing informal conversation language rather specific literal figures formal quantitative measurements careful scrutiny meticulous attention detailed calculations thorough analysis comprehensive study rigorous investigation exhaustive evaluation extensive research empirical evidence qualitative data analytic methods statistical hypothesis testing scientific approach methodologically sound precise experimental design statistically significant result reproducible findings replicable outcome peer review process academic scholarship critical thinking logical reasoning rational deductions inferences inductively valid arguments abductively plausible conjectures tentatively hypothesized possible implications further developments future directions extension scope potential applications real world relevance practical utility societal impact farreaching consequences ethical considerations moral principles human rights universal justice",
        " depth becomes two-thirds (or about 0.66) of this amount. This means multiplying 24 by one minus half because three fifths would leave you with only twice as deep or two times whatever fraction remains when subtracting half. Thus we get approximately 19.2 feet. Hence, rounding up since we can not practically measure lesser portions in our context leads us to say around/approximately equal to full units. Final ",
