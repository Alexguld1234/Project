        " rate per minute (1755185) times the time spent collecting (180 minutes), we get 1755185 * 180 = approximately 315933300. This means John collected around 315933300 peaches over those three hours. Note however, since such quantities aren\u2019t typical or plausible for human activities under normal conditions (collecting thousands of fruits per second/minute isn't realistic), it seems like either mistake might exist somewhere if not otherwise specified clearly as imaginative context; so use care when interpreting results here!

I hope these additional problems helped you solidify your understanding of basic arithmetic operations and problem solving using those skills. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask if any confusion arises during future exercises.",
        " means (3 x 60) minutes since we know one hour consists out of sixty mins. This makes it equal to 180 minutes. Since John gets approximately 1755185 peerches every minute, We multiply this amount per min by seconds collected time so as to get actual output; therefore (1755185*180). Therefore doing all these calculations equals 315783300 Peaches! Thus the ",

I apologize but my calculation seems wrong according to your question logic; since you told us that \u201che\u201d doesn\u2019t really take half seconds as time unit while calculating our result.

Since he worked for three hours therefore getting 105301100*3=315903300 pecthes. The answer is: 315903300. Let me know if you need further explanation!
