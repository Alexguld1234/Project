        " the vase we add together both quantities which means  8043777 (roses) + 8043784 (dahlias). This equals , making it possible through addition . Therefore , this question can actually only get answered correctly if you know your sums without calculating them explicitly first as mentioned before.. We multiply digits according their places using digit multiplication table rules like adding carries along way upwards starting from right hand side or unit place until all columns containing products/multiples calculated till hundredth decimal place etc; carry over happens when multiplying single numbers greater beyond ten iii so carrying forward would increase overall result slightly but won\u2019t matter too much since no further significant figures needed here nor negative decimals involved henceforth nothing gets carried away across lines except maybe one extra zero(outside ones column); plus another couple zeros comes our way thanks also because summing results eventually produces exact figure required !
