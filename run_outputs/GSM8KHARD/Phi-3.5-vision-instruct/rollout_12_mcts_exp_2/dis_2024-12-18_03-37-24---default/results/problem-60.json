Jeff wants to buy twice as many bags of apples as bags of oranges for making fruit pies this weekend. Each apple tree yields about 130 pounds of fruits while each orange tree produces around 110 pounds. Apples are sold in half-pound bags costing $.5 per bag, whereas orange bags are priced at $0.65 per piece due to their larger size containing one full pound only. At present, Jeff owns sixteen apple trees; fifteen orange trees occupy three acres within his large farmhouse estate. Given these details calculate what would be the average price paid per hour if Jeff takes eight hours cooking sessions every Saturday morning using up four types of ingredients sourced according to market fluctuations throughout the year affecting prices over time which might result into spending ranging anywhere near twelve bucks but never exceeding twenty seven when compared against current consumer trends indicating preference shifts towards healthier options including gluten free diets etc..
