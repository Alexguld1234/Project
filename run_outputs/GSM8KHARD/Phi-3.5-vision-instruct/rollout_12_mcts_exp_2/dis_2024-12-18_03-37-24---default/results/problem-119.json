On Saturday and Sunday, since it was mentioned only once per 'weekend', we can assume this applies both Saturdays and Sundays so pancho walked twice as 2 times 10 which equals another 20 miles throughout these two days too. Therefore, adding all three together; you get your solution\u2014100+20=120 kilometers or rather about 74.56 km. To convert into Miles use the conversion factor [Kilometers / Mile] ; approximately equaling around ~74.56/kilometers*x[1 mile]=1 Km.[Here I converted kilometer resultant above].

During weekends, walking distance doubles thus adding another half mile per hour i.e.,  1*10*(total time spent) /7 weeks . But this quantity cannot be quantified without knowing 'the typical length of time spend doing exercise'. We can only calculate assuming standard hours based upon common workdays but since it doesn\u2019t mention anything about working full or part times we assume him as casual worker who takes roughly similar duration during normal days(5 Days). Thus considering such approximations , let us take average daily span across 7 days as being X minutes. From general statistics regarding outdoor activities like biking & jogging, around three quarters would probably say you need less than one hr usually so lets go ahead using that approximation hence having approximately sixteen percent increase because of longer stride gait while comparing non running equivalent speed against regular short burst sprint type intensity runners under mild terrain condition typically observed most people choose low intensitity rather high intense sustained runs especially if exercises involve covering large area even faster speeds over extended period could cause fatigue effect reducing overall efficiency plus elevation changes causing slower progress despite greater distances covered due too extreme efforts exertion stress placed onto muscles tendons ligaments joint capsule structures internal organs skin system nervous sensory sense etc..
