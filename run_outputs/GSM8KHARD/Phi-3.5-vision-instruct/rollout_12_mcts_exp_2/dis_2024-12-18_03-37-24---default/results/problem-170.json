        " Since Kylie collected 5 more than him on Monday, it means Kylie gathered 9266960 + 5 = 9266965 shells on Monday. Given that on Tuesday, Kylie managed to gather twice as many as she found on Monday; this amounts to 2*9266965=18533930 shells on Tuesday. Therefore, the amount kylie collected on Tuesday was exactly double what she amassed on Monday resulting into totalling up to  18533930\u00a0shells. Hence, your result matches our calculation so we can confidently state that indeed Kylie managed to accumulate a sum which equaled or exceeded 185 million shells during their adventure at sea under bright sunshine around noon time (the exact moment captured when taken through camera device).

        " him so this makes it 9266960+5 which equals to 9266965. Since Kylie collection was twice as big compared to what happened on Mon, we get 2* (9266965), because multiplying anything doubles its size or amount. When you multiply those upwards numbers above separately using math equation formula Pxq=PQ You will realize that the results obtained come out approximately equaling about 18.5 million plus three hundred thousand i rounded off , just to say roughly .
