But since we don't know exactly how big these last bits of uneatable scraps may potentially fit back together as wholes again if reassembled somehow...

To find out how many guest portions took place before this leftover amount arrived we need subtract these ones too: This means it happened earlier than what you might expect since grandmother wanted everybody take one but let them eat as many or little slices as liked \u2013 which caused confusion when counting properly.. That said instead use just half times those numbers plus twelve extra servings : ((total_pieces / num_piece) /numPieces)*(half+twelve)=((21127790)/(4)+1*0)(0.5+2), hence around seventy thousand eight hundred fifty six people managed getting enough snack during dessert; however only twenty three dozen remained unsold . Thus approximately nineteen million fourteen thousands seven hundred sixty minus eighteen millions ten tens fifteen equals ~seven million fourteen score thirty nines (=three digits less=six digit difference!) thus no single integer divisor could fit exactly within our constraints/range unless using multiples etc., therefore assuming everyone consumed equal amounts makes zero sense here\u2026 But maybe not really?? Why bother doing anything about fractions anyway??? And wouldn't want us running afoul trying calculate fractional parts! ;) Oh wait !!! It seems like perhaps considering every serving separately matters because somehow having larger quantities available may lead better distribution among groups size... Hint again!!!

        " That means all the pies together make up 5*4225558 or  21127790 pieces. By saying there are still only 14 pieces of apples untouched when it finished serving those who came during this time can imply something wrong about grandmother herself since we assume no piece of fruit went missing (not yet). Hence one may deduce whether someone took extra!

All these calculations suggest no matter how big/small serving preferences vary among diners neither demographic nor nutritional profiles dictate anything else than simple arithmetic operations applied universally towards achieving harmony within any gatherings like family reunion meals! Well actually yes; it goes beyond just dividing food equally based upon body sizes since human nature tends toward selfishness which manifest through preference differentiation according age gender ethnicity social status etc.; making everything seemingly chaotic especially during holiday seasons hence creating conflicts leading eventually either directly violently resulting casualties often without justice administered swiftly efficiently while simultaneously seeking personal gain whether materialistic emotion related nonprofit community work orientations spiritual devout religious ideologies altruist principles morality values charitable acts compassion volunteerism philanthropy mutually beneficial partnerships peace negotiations diplomatic treaties peacemaking endeavors reconciliation efforts constructive mediation methods alternative dispute resolution procedures restorative justice initiatives transformational change processes equitable resource sharing distribution networks egalitarian policies public welfare programs citizen engagement civic participation advocacy campaign organizing grassroots movements lobbying politicians policymakers international cooperation solidarity unity cohesiveness collaborators consensus decisionmaking facilitation conflict management strategies structured dialogue discussions roundtable summits negotiation tables interactive conferences virtual meetings webinars seminars panels debates talkback shows town halls press conferences interviews panelists moderators judges jury commission officers mediators arbitrators conciliators adjudicators enforcement agencies regulatory bodies governing authorities executive leadership governance counsel legal advice mentoring supervision training development experts consultants scholars research scientists educators"
