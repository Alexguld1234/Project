Suppose someone decides otherwise than just relying completely only single model approach like perhaps trying other models maybe polynomial regression etc.,then things could certainly get quite complex very quickly unless somebody really knows exactly why such techniques called Time Series Forecast Modelling exist precisely namely helping deal appropriately across different time periods without getting tangled ourselves unnecessarily amidst non sense theories around correlation vs causation phenomena often misinterpreted especially concerning subject matters entangling themselves intricately intertwined deep inside human psyche thus creating unnecessary confusion leading ultimately towards incorrect conclusions altogether despite being aware everything else perfectly fine well beyond doubt entirely logical reasoning apart form ignorance itself!

Thus, purchasing any product under either plan may not matter here due to such low percentage increases; even so, it would result in less gain choosing Plan B ($electronic). To choose wisely among options regarding expected returns per unit cost you could divide potential profits by original price, obtaining percentages directly comparable across investments : %jewelry= 125/5000*100%= 2.5% ,and similarly%,gadget=(96/8000)*100%= %.
