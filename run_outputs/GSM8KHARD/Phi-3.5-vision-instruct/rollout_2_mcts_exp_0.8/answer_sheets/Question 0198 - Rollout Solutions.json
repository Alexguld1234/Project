First, we know Mary bought three bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 7930843 M&Ms. The second bag has 7930843 + 12 = 7930855 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, which means it has 7930843 / 2 = 3965421.5 M&Ms (since you can't have half a M&M, let's round down to 3965421). To find out the total amount of M&Ms, add up all three amounts: 7930843 + 7930855 + 3965421 = 19827119.
