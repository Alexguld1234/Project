John has 10 hectares of land with 100 pineapples per hectare. That means he grows 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples. Since he can harvest them every 3 months, he can make one round of harvests in 12 / 3 = 4 rounds in a year. Therefore, he can harvest 1000 * 4 = 4000 pineapples in a year. The answer is: 4000.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
