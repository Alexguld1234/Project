Firstly, calculate how many questions Mark could finish during the first test within the allotted time frame using his completion rate (5 questions/hour).

Next, evaluate how many questions he could address during the following test session. With 6 hours available and a consistent pace, he managed to work through 30 questions since 5 multiplied by 6 results in 30.
