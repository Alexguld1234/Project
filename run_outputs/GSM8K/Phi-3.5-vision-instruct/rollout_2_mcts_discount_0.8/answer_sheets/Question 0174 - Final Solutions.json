First we need to convert the time taken to peel a potato into seconds since the other part needs to be measured in seconds as well. We know there are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes becomes 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds. Since peeling one potato takes 90 seconds and cutting also takes 5 seconds, this means each potato takes a total of 90 + 5 = 95 seconds to prep. Then, since he'll be doing this 60 times, it will take him 95 * 60 = 5700 seconds to complete all the potatoes. Converting these back to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute), getting 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes. The hint tells us not to forget about the fact that cutting time comes out faster than peeling time, which means the cutting doesn't add any extra time beyond what would already be needed if everything took 90 seconds like peeling.
