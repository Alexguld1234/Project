First, we need to convert everything into the same unit (inches), because there are different units involved here (rolls, croissants, and baguettes). Rolls are 4 inches each, so 300 rolls are 300 * 4 = 1200 inches. Chocolate croissants are already 60 feet long, which is also 60 * 12 = 720 inches. Baguettes are 2 feet long each, so 60 baguettes are 60 * 2 * 12 = 1440 inches. Adding them up, we get 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches. To find out how many feet this equals, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot.

First, we convert the inches to feet since our other measurements are already in feet. 1 foot equals 12 inches, so 1200 inches divided by 12 is equal to 100 feet. Next, let's add up the lengths of all the croissants and baguettes. Each croissant is 6 inches or 6/12 = 0.5 feet and there are 120 of them. So their combined length is 120 x 0.5 = 60 feet. And each baguette is 2 feet and there are 60 of them, so their combined length is 60 x 2 = 120 feet. Finally, add together all the lengths: 100 (rolls) + 60 (croissants) + 120 (baguettes) = 280 feet.
