First, we need to find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 \u2248 6.67 liters of water. Since you spilled one liter during the pouring process, you actually used approximately 6.67 - 1 = 5.67 liters of water from the orange drink. Next, calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink; three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters of water. Combining these amounts, the total water volume is 5.67 + 9 = 14.67 liters.
