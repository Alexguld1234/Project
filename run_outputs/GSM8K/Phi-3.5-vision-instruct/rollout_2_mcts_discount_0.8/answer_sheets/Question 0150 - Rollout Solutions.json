There are 5280 feet in a mile, so 3 miles is equal to 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Steve bikes to school and back, taking 38 minutes round trip. Tim rides his skateboard to school, which takes him longer (40 minutes). Since Steve reaches first, we subtract Tim's travel time from Steve's. 38 - 40 yields -2, but since negative times don't make sense here, this means Steve arrives 2 minutes earlier. So, Tim will wait exactly 2 minutes because Steve gets home faster.
