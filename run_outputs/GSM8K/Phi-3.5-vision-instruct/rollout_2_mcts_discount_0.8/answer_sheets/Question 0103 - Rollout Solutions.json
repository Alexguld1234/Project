Firstly, we need to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile since it takes 10 minutes for every 3 miles. We know it takes about 3.33 minutes to cover one mile because 10 minutes divided by 3 equals roughly 3.33. Next, multiply this time per mile by the total distance of the city, which is 42 miles. So, 3.33 minutes per mile multiplied by 42 miles equals 140.26 minutes. However, you can't have a fraction of a minute when counting full minutes as part of your solution, so let's round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is approximately 140 minutes.
