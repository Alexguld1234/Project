Since each sub costs $7.50 and she ordered 2, it will cost 2 * $7.50 = $15.00 Next, we need to calculate the total cost without tax or tips. So far, she spent $15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00 Now, let's calculate the 20% delivery fee. It will be 20/100 * $20.00 = $4.00 Finally, we need to add the $5.00 tip.
