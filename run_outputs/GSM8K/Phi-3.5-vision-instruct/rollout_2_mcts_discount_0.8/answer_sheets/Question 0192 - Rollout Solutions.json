However, we need to consider the death rate of 30%. Therefore, if 30% of the trees die, it means 30/100 * 130 = 39 trees die.

First, calculate the net increase per year for Tom: he plants 10 trees but loses 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees annually. Over 10 years, the total increase would be 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. Adding these to the original count of 50 trees brings us to 130 trees before any losses. Next, figure out the number of trees that died. Since 30% of the trees died, we can calculate this as follows: 30% death rate means 30/100 * 130 dead trees which equals 39 dead trees. To find the remaining number of trees, subtract the dead ones from the total: 130 - 39 = 91 trees. The answer is: 91.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
