First, we find out how many hours Frankie spent watching TV on Monday and Tuesday. Since he watched one hour per night, it's just 1+1=2 hours. On Thursday, he watched one 1-hour episode and half a 30-minute episode, which is equivalent to 1/2 hour. This makes 2+1/2 = 2.5 hours accounted for. He also watched 2*1-1=3 hours on Friday (since both episodes are 1 hour long). So far, Frankie has watched 2.5+3=5.5 hours of TV before Wednesday. Therefore, on Wednesday, he watched 7-5.5=1.5 hours of TV. One 30-minute episode equals half an hour or 0.5 hours. Hence, Frankie watched 1.5/0.5=3.0 episodes on Wednesday. The answer is: 3.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
