With 10 packs and 6 cookies per pack, he has 10 * 6 = 60 cookies. Next, we need to calculate how much money he spent on these cookies. Each cookie was $0.10, so 60 * $0.10 = $6. Finally, let's see how much change he received when he paid with a $10 bill. Subtracting the total cost of the cookies ($6) from the amount paid ($10), we get $10 - $6 = $4.
