They took one third of those, which means 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos were taken. Those 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out again, so we still count them as pink. They also added another 18 pink flamingos on Sunday. So, before adding the extra 18 on Sunday, there were already 18 (initial) + 6 (painted but counted as pink) = 24 pink flamingos. Since only new pink flamingos were added on Sunday, all the remaining ones stay the same. The hint tells us the original count was 18; hence, it doesn\u2019t change regardless of any additions or changes throughout the weekend.
