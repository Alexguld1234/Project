Firstly, we need to find out what 10% of the monthly fee is. That is 10/100 * 140 = $14 discount. So during the second half of the year (also 6 months), the new rate will be 140 - 14 = $126 per month. Therefore, over the next 6 months, she would pay 126 * 6 = $756. Adding up both halves together ($840 + $756), we get the total amount of money she spent throughout the whole year. 840 + 756 equals 1596.
