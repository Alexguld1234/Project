Henry stopped after riding 20 miles. From there, he continued another 15 miles until his second stop. To find out how far he went between the two stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop (20 miles) from the distance to his second stop (60 miles). So, 60 - 20 = 40 miles. But since he only rode 40 miles until he reached his first stop and not all the way through to his second stop, we need to consider half of that distance because it's 15 miles towards the next stop. Half of 40 is 20. So, Henry traveled 20 miles between his first and second stops.
