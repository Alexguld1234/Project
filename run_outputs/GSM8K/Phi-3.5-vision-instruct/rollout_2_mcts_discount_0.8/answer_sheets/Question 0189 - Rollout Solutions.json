First, we know that three friends spent a total of $20.25 on tickets. Additionally, they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. This means they spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.\nNext, they went on two different rides which cost $33 each. Therefore, the total cost of their fair trip including rides was $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.\nLastly, since the three friends agreed to split all the costs equally, each person paid $102 / 3 = $34.
