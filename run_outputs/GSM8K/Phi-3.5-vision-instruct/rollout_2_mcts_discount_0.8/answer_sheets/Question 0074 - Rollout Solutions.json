Marigolds go up to $3 (from $2.74), petunias down to $2 (from $1.87) and begonias stay as $2 (since it rounds up). Next, we multiply these rounded prices by the number of pots sold for each flower type. For marigolds, he makes $3 times 12, which equals $36. For petunias, he makes $2 times 9, equaling $18.
