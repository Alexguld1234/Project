The problem states the first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each. Then the next two customers bought 2 DVDs each. We multiply these quantities by their respective customers. First 3 customers = 3 x 1 = 3 DVDs, Next 2 customers = 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs. So, before considering those last three customers, Billy sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.", "2": "The remaining 3 customers did not purchase any DVDs.

Three customers bought 1 DVD each which means 3 DVDs. Two customers bought 2 DVDs each so it adds up to 2*2= 4 DVDs. Lastly, the other three customers didn't buy any DVDs. So adding all together, 3+4 equals 7. Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday. The answer is: 7.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Billy sells DVDs.
