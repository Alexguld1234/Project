There are 6 numbers on a standard six-sided die.", "2": "Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. This includes rolling a 4, 5, or 6.

Firstly, we calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. Since Jerry can roll a 4, 5, or 6, these are three favourable outcomes out of six possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2. Secondly, let's consider the consecutive even numbers. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2 and 4. To get consecutive even numbers, Jerry could either start with a 2 followed by a 4, or with a 4 followed by a 2. These are also two possibilities. Each scenario has a probability of 1/6 \u00d7 1/6 because after rolling one even number, only one result remains valid for the second roll due to the restriction of getting another even number immediately after. Therefore, the combined probability of both scenarios happening consecutively is 2 \u00d7 1/6 \u00d7 1/6 = 2/36 = 1/18.\n\nNow to find the difference in likelihood expressed as a percentage, subtract the smaller fractional value from the larger. So we need to convert them into percentages first. 1/2 converts to about 50% while 1/18 converts to approximately 5.56%. Subtracting these two values gives us 50% - 5.56% = 44.44%. Hence, it's around 44.44% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than it is that he gets two even numbers in a row.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
