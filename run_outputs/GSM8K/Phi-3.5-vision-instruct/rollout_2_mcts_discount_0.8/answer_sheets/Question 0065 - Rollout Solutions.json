Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for 1 hour (which is half the TV time). That makes 3 hours per session. He does this 3 times a week, so 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week. Over 4 weeks, 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours. The answer is: 36.", "value": 0.71875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
