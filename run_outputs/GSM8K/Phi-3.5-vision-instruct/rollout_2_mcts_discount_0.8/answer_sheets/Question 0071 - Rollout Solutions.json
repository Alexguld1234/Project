First, let's find out how many instructions are in the second recipe. We know that the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, if the first has 20 instructions, the second would have 20 * 2 = 40 instructions. To find the total amount of instructions, add both recipes together, so 20 (from the first) + 40 (from the second) equals 60 instructions in total.
