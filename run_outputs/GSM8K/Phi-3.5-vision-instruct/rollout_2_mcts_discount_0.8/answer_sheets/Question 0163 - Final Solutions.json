We know that a doll costs as much as 3 action figures plus the price of one red car. One red car costs $4, so a doll costs 3 * $5 (action figure) + $4 = $15 + $4 = $19. Since 5 red cars cost 5 * $4 = $20 and we don't have information about any other toy except for their prices relative to others, we can only calculate what was asked for. So if an action figure costs $5, we add up $19 (doll), $15 ($5 action figure multiplied by 3), and $20 (red cars). That makes it a total value of $19 + $15 + $20 = $54.
