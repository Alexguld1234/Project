Kyle received a 25% discount on the book which means he paid 75% (100% - 25%) of the original price. Let X be the original price. Therefore, 0.75X = $19.50. To find X we need to divide both sides by 0.75: X = $19.50 / 0.75, so X equals $26. Therefore, the original price was $26.

Kyle paid $19.50 after getting a 25% discount, which means he got only 75% (100% - 25%) of the original price. To find the original price before discount, let's call it x. Then we can write the equation as 0.75x = $19.50. Solving for x, we get x = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00. Since the original price was $26 and he paid $19.50, the new discount should also represent $6.50 off from the original price ($26 - $19.50). Thus, the new discount rate would be ($6.50 / $26) * 100%. Calculation shows us that the discount needed to make $19.50 is approximately 25%.

Kyle paid $19.50 which was after getting a 25% discount. To find out the original price before the discount, we need to reverse the process. Let's call the original price P. The equation would be P - (P * 25%) = 19.50. Simplifying it, we get P - (P/4) = 19.50 or 3P/4 = 19.50. Multiplying both sides by 4/3, we get P = 19.50 * 4 / 3, which simplifies to 26.
