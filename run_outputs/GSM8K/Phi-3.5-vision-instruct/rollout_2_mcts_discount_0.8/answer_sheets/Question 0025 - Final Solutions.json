First, let's find out the total cost without the unknown quantity of pizzas. Marie spent $12 on the chicken meal, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, which adds up to $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. Since Marie paid a total of $50, the amount spent on pizzas would be $50 - $33 = $17. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes she bought, divide the total cost by the cost per box: $17 / $8.50 = 2 (rounded down). So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
