To find out how much money she makes, we need to multiply the number of students by the cost per student. So, 15 students times $15.00 equals $225.00. However, this calculation applies only to one class. To find out how much money she makes in one week, we would need to multiply the earnings per class by the total number of classes in a week. Since we already know that she teaches 33 classes in one week, we multiply 225.00 by 33 to get 7425.00. Therefore, Judy makes 7425.00 in one week.
