Since one dozen is 12 eggs, we divide the daily production by 12: 252 eggs / 12 = 21 dozens. For selling price, multiply dozens by the cost per dozen: 21 dozens x $2/dozen = $42. Since this is the daily earnings, we have to multiply it by 7 (days in a week) to get the weekly income: 42 x 7 = $294.

First we need to know how many eggs make one dozen. One dozen contains 12 eggs. To find out how many dozens are in 252 eggs, divide 252 by 12 which equals 21 (since 21 * 12 = 252).
