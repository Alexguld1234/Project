According to the hint, there are twice as many boys as girls, which means there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys. Each student group (boys or girls) has 5 students per teacher. We add the number of boys and girls together (120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students). To find out how many groups fit into this number of students, we divide by 5 because each group fits 5 students.
