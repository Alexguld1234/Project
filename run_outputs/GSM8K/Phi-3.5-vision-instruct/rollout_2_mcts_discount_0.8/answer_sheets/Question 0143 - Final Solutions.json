We know John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. Adding them together gives us 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars. Next, we need to identify what counts as nonfood items for tax calculation. These include milk ($2), light bulbs ($3), cups ($3), and roach traps ($4). Their combined cost sums up to 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12 dollars. To find out the tax, we multiply the combined cost by the tax rate, which is 10%. So, 12 * 0.10 = 1.20 dollars. Lastly, we add the tax to the subtotal to determine the overall cost. Thus, 15 + 1.20 equals 16.20 dollars.
