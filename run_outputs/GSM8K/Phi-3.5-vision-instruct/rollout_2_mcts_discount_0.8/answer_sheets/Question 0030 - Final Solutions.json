First, we identify the sum of parts in their ratio which is 7 (for Darrell) plus 11 (for Allen), making it 18 parts. Since their total age is 162, we find the value of one part as 162 divided by 18, which equals 9 years per part. Allen\u2019s share of the age is represented by 11 parts because the ratio is 7:11. His current age is therefore 11 times the size of one part, so Allen is currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old. To find his age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.
