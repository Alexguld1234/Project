If Jackie doesn't hire the accountant, she would lose $105. But if she hires the accountant, she saves $15. The difference between these amounts tells us whether Jackie wins or loses financially depending on which option she chooses. By subtracting the potential loss without the accountant ($105) from the savings when hiring one ($90), we find that Jackie actually ends up saving money by getting professional help.
