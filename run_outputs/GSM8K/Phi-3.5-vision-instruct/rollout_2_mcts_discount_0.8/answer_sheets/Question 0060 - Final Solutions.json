We know that out of 25 oranges, we have information about 1 being bad (rotten), 2 being sour, and 20% being unripe. First, let\u2019s calculate how many unripe oranges there are since it's already mentioned as a percentage. To find 20% of 25, we can multiply 25 by 0.20, which equals 5 unripe oranges. With these numbers accounted for:\n\n- Bad: 1\n- Sour: 2\n- Unripe: 5\n\nWe need to add them up: 1+2+5=8. That leaves us with 25 - 8 = 17 good oranges. However, this calculation would not include all possible combinations of unripe, bad, and sour oranges because those categories may overlap. To ensure accuracy, we use hints provided instead of calculating overlaps directly. According to the hint, we indeed have 2 sour oranges.

We start with 25 oranges. One is spoiled, so we subtract it, leaving us with 25 - 1 = 24 oranges.
