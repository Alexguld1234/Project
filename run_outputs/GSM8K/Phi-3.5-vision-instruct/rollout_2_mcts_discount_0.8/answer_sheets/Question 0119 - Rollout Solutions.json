Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, we can say that Adrien made 1.3 times the amount that Lylah made at that time.

Firstly, we find out Lylah's salary four years ago using the hint provided earlier which amounts to approximately $30769.23. Secondly, Adrien's salary four years ago is stated as $40000. According to the problem statement, if Adrien's salary increased by 40% over those four years, then Adrien's salary currently becomes $56000 (since 40000 * 1.4).\n\nNow we add both salaries to get their combined income four years later: 56000(Adrien's Salary) + 30769.23(Lylah's Salary) equals to 86769.23.
