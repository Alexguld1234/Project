Firstly, we need to find out the total number of units in the building which is 15 floors multiplied by 8 units per floor. This equals 120 units in total. We know that 3/4 of these units are occupied, so this means that 3/4 * 120 = 90 units are occupied. To find out how many units remain unoccupied, subtract the occupied units (90) from the total units (120). Therefore, the calculation would be 120 - 90 = 30 units remaining.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

To do this, multiply the total number of units (120) by the fraction of occupancy (3/4). That would be 120 * (3/4) = 90 occupied units.
