Billy's customers initially made up three distinct groups based on the hints provided. The first group of three customers each purchased one DVD; thus, they contributed 3 DVDs to Billy's sales. The second group of two customers each purchased two DVDs, making them contribute 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs into Billy\u2019s inventory. Adding these amounts together gives us a sum of 3 (from the first group) + 4 (from the second group), which equals 7 DVDs.
