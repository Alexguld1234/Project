Brooke's age right now would be represented as B, so Seth's current age is 2B because he is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, Brooke's age will be B+2 and Seth's age will be 2B+2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will equal 28, which means (B+2) + (2B+2) = 28. Simplifying this equation, we get 3B + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides leaves us with 3B = 24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us B = 8. Therefore, since Seth is twice as old as Brooke right now, Seth\u2019s current age is 2 * 8 = 16.

In 2 years, Brooke will be B+2 years old and Seth will be S+2 years old. Their combined ages will add up to 28, so we can write this equation: (B+2) + (S+2) = 28.
