Since he bought twice as many red ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which is an additional 50/100 * 40 = $20 per red tie. So, each red tie costs 40 + 20 = $60. \nSo, the amount he spent on red ties was 10 * 60 = $600. Therefore, he spent a total of 200 (blue) + 600 (red) = $800 on ties.
