Firstly, Dana's skipping speed is 3 mph which means her running speed (four times faster) would be 4 * 3 = 12 mph.

During these 2 hours, she would cover 12mph * 2hrs = 24 miles.\n\nFor walking, two-thirds of six hours is about 4 hours i.e., 2/3*6=4 hrs. During this period she would cover 6mph * 4hrs = 24 miles.\n\nSo adding both distances together we get 24+24=48 miles.
