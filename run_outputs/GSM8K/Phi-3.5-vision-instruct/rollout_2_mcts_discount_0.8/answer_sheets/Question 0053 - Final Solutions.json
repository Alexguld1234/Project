[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, calculate the revenue earned on Thursday: 6 truck tires at $60 each plus 4 car tires at $40 each equals (6*60) + (4*40). That means 360+160 which equals 520.\nNext, calculate the revenue earned on Friday: only car tires are being repaired, so it's just 12 car tires at $40 each. That amounts to 12*40, which equals 480.\nFinally, find out which day had the highest revenue. Since the revenues are 520 on Thursday and 480 on Friday, Thursday was the day with higher revenue.\nTo determine how much more revenue was made, subtract the smaller amount from the larger one: 520 - 480 = 40.\nSo the mechanic made $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Firstly, we know the mechanic earns $60 per truck tire repair.

On Thursday, he fixed 4 car tires, so he earned 4 * 40 = $160 from car tire repairs.\nCombining these, his total earning on Thursday was 360 (from truck tires) + 160 (from car tires) = $520.\n\nNext, let's find out about his earnings on Friday. From Condition 3, we know that on Friday, he repaired 12 car tires. Since no truck tires were fixed on Friday, only those car tires were considered for calculating the Friday earnings.\nTherefore, for Friday, his earnings would be 12 * 40 = $480.\n\nNow, let's compare his earnings across both days. His total earnings on Thursday were $520, while it was just $480 on Friday. This means his earnings decreased on Friday compared to Thursday.\nTo calculate the difference in his earnings, subtract the Friday earnings ($480) from the Thursday earnings ($520): 520 - 480 = $40.\nSo, his daily earnings decrease by $40 when comparing the two days.
