First, we calculate how much money John earned from selling his lego sets: 13 lego sets at $15 each equals $195. Next, we calculate how much he spent on the video games: 8 video games at $20 each equals $160. Finally, we check if he had enough money. He earned $195 but spent $160, which leaves him with $35 (195 - 160). Since John has $5 left over, this means that he sold all his 13 lego sets as planned because even though he bought the video games, he had enough funds ($35) remaining after the purchases. Therefore, the question might contain incorrect information since it assumes that after spending money on video games, he would no longer own any lego sets when actually, he would still own them unless further transactions occurred. Based on the provided data about earnings from the lego sets sales and expenditures on video games, we can infer that John still has those 13 lego sets.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
