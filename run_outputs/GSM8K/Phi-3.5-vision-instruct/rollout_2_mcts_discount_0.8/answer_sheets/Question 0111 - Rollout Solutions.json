First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed before stopping. She stopped when it was 64 seconds away from the shore and needed 16 seconds per 10 feet. 64 / 16 = 4 intervals of 10 feet (40 feet). Each interval adds 2 liters of water, so 4 intervals would add 4 * 2 = 8 liters of water. Thus, Julia's boat had taken on 8 liters of water by the time she reached shore.
