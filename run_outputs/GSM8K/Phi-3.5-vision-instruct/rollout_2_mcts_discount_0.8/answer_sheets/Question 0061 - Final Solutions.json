Firstly, we know that Janet spent $500 on materials which was already included in the cost of $800 to the jeweler. Therefore, even before adding any extra costs or fees, she has incurred $1300 in expenses (the summed up payment). Now, let's apply the condition stated about insurance. Janet needs to pay 10% of the $800 she owes the jeweler as an insurance premium. To find out what this is, calculate 10% of $800, which is 800 * 10/100 = $80. Adding this additional cost to the initial total, so 1300 + 80 equals $1380. However, since the $800 originally includes all the costs previously mentioned, including those already accounted in the $500 for materials, we need not add the $80 again; instead, just add the insurance fee directly to our original figure. Thus, the correct calculation yields 1300 (initial total) + 80 (insurance premium) = $1380.
