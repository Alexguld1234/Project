First, we need to find out how many blue ties John bought. Since it costs $40 per tie and he spent $200, he must have bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nNext, since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he must have bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.\n\nWe know the price of a blue tie ($40) and therefore can calculate the price of a red tie (since it's 50% more). To get this amount, we take half of the blue tie's cost which is $40 / 2 = $20 extra. We add this to the base cost of the blue tie ($40) so a red tie would cost $40 + $20 = $60.\n\nNow let's check if our calculations make sense. John spends exactly $200 on red ties. With each red tie costing $60, dividing $200 by $60 gives us approximately 3.33, rounding down because you cannot purchase a fractional tie. Therefore, he bought 3 red ties. However, according to previous information, he bought twice as many red ties as blue ones. Hence, the calculations seem correct. So the answer is: 5.", "value": 0.6}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Using Hint 1: John bought 5 blue ties.\nUsing Hint 1: John bought 2 times as many red ties as blue ties, hence 5 * 2 = 10 red ties.\nUsing Hint 1: The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, meaning each red tie costs $40 + ($40 * 50%) = $60.\nSo, John spent $200 on blue ties and $60 * 10 = $600 on red ties, summing up to $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.
