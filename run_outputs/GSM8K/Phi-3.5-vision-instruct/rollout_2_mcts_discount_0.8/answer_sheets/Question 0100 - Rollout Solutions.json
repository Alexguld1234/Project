The first friend pressed the bell 20 times, the second friend pressed it 1/4 * 20 = 5 times more than the first friend, so she pressed it 20 + 5 = 25 times. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times.

First friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.\n2. Second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, which means 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 25 times.\n3. Fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.\n4. Let's denote the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell as X. Since the third friend's presses equal the sum of presses by all friends, X = 20 + 25 + 60. Solving this equation, we get X = 105.\n\nNow let's add up the presses made by all friends to find out the total number of doorbell rings: 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 105 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 210.\n\nSo, the doorbell rang 210 times.

First, we calculate the number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell based on the hint. The second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times because it was 1/4 more than what the first friend pressed, which was 20 times. We know the fourth friend pressed 60 times. The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 * 10 = 600 times.
