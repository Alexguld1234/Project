First friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.\n2. Second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, which means 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 25 times.\n3. Fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.\n4. Let's denote the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell as X. Since the third friend's presses equal the sum of presses by all friends, X = 20 + 25 + 60.
