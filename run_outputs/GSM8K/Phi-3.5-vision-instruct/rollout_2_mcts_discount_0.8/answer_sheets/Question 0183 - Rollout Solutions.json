Team 1 finishes their race in 55 seconds per 400m leg, so their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.\n\nNow, let's find out the times for Team 2's members. They start at 58 seconds for the first leg, then 55, 52, 49 for subsequent legs, creating an arithmetic progression.\n\nFor Team 2, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series S_n = n/2(a_1 + a_n), where n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term. Here, n=4, a_1=58, and a_4=49. Plugging values into the formula, we get:\n\nS_4 = 4/2(58 + 49) = 2(107) = 214 seconds.\n\nTeam 2 takes 214 seconds while Team 1 takes 220 seconds.
