Firstly, we list out the prices of each item: Milk for $2, Eggs for $3, Light bulbs for $3, Cups for $3, and Roach traps for $4. Adding these together gives us a subtotal before taxes: 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = $15. Since only non-food items need to pay tax, and all the items here can be considered as non-food, the entire amount goes into the tax calculation. With a tax rate of 10%, we calculate the tax amount: 10% of $15 is $1.50. To find the total cost including tax, add the tax amount to the subtotal: $15 + $1.50 = $16.50. The answer is: 16.50.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
