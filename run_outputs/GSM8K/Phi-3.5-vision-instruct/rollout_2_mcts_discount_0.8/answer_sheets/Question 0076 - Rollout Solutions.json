One bag contains 110 cups, so 180 / 110 rounds down to approximately 1.636 bags. We round this up because you cannot purchase a fractional part of a bag, resulting in 2 full bags used in those initial months. Afterward, she feeds the puppy 2 cups daily until its death (we don't know the exact number). Without knowing the lifespan of the puppy, we can't determine exactly when she starts using 2 cups daily nor how long she will continue to do so; therefore, we cannot calculate the total number of bags needed based solely on these provided details.

First, calculate how many cups of dog food are needed for the initial 180 days: 180 days * 1 cup per day = 180 cups. Next, find out how many days remain in the first year (assuming it's not specified): 365 days - 180 days = 185 days. Calculate the daily requirement post 180 days: 2 cups per day. Multiply 2 cups/day by 185 days remaining: 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups. Add both amounts together: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups. Finally, divide by the amount in one bag: 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags. The answer is: 5 bags.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
