We know that out of the 240 Asians, 80 were Japanese which means the remaining Asians were Chinese, so 240 - 80 = 160 Chinese. Since we know that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team and all of them were Asian, if subtracting this from the total number of Chinese racers would give us the number of girls on the team, we can calculate it as follows: 160 - 60 = 100. Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.
