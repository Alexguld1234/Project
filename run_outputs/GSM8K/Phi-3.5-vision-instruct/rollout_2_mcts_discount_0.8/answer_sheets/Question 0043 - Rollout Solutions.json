First, we need to find out how many calories are left until reaching the daily goal. You're aiming for 2000 calories but have already had 1800, so you still need 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Then divide this amount by the caloric content per gram (250 calories per serving) as hinted; thus, it would take you about 48.14 grams of chips to meet your caloric intake based on what's left in the bag.
