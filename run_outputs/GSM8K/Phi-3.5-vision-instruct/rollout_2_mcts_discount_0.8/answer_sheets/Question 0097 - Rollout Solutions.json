Since the tomato sauce is only 32 ounces but would normally be twice as thick (64 ounces), we need to find out how many cans this equates to at full volume. Each can makes 64 ounces when not reduced, so 32 ounces come from half of that amount, which means there was 64 / 2 = 32 ounces worth of sauce in one can used.\n\nEach can holds three tomatoes, so if each of these 32 ounces of sauce comes from one whole can, Freda used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Question: How many tomatoes did Freda use in making her last batch of sauce?", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine the volume per can before it gets cooked down as per condition 1. Each can contains 3 tomatoes at 16 ounces each, so the volume is 3 * 16 = 48 ounces."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Before being cooked down, one can of tomatoes equals 3 tomatoes at 16 ounces each, which means each can is 48 ounces. Since 16 ounces become 8 ounces once cooked (half), we need to find out what fractional part of a full can becomes sauce.\nWe know that Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, equivalent to 32 / 8 = 4 full portions of sauce made from a single can. Thus, four times the original amount of sauce comes from one whole can of tomatoes (before they get reduced). Therefore, Freda used 3 tomatoes * 4 parts = 12 Tomatoes in her last batch of sauce.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
