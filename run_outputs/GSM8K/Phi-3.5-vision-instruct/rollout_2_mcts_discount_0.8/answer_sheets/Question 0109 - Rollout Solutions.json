First, we calculate the original cost of the 10 gallons of gas which would be $3.00 multiplied by 10, equaling $30.00. Next, we calculate the cashback amount. At $.20 per gallon, over 10 gallons the cashback would be $.20 times 10, which equals $2.00. Finally, subtract the cashback from the original cost to find out what the customer spends after the cashback. So, $30.00 minus $2.00 results in $28.00. The answer is: $28.00.", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
