Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 6 hours each (8 - 2). That adds up to 12 hours for those two days.

First, calculate Sadie's sleep for the first three days. On Monday she slept 8 hours, Tuesday and Wednesday she slept 6 hours each day. That's 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours for the first three days. Since these days are part of the same week, add them together to get 20 hours. Then we need to find out how many hours she slept for the remaining four days. We know it was one hour more than what she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, which means she slept 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours each day for those four days. Thus, for the last four days, she slept 7 hours/day * 4 days = 28 hours. Finally, we add the three days' sleep to the remaining four days' sleep: 20 hours + 28 hours = 48 hours.
