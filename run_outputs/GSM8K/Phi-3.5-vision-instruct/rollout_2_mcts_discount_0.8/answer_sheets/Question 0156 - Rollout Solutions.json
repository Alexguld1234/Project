Monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and baboons need 100 bananas. Add these together to get the total monthly requirement which is 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas. Since the zookeeper needs enough bananas to last for 2 months, multiply this by 2. Thus, 700 bananas * 2 months equals 1400 bananas.
