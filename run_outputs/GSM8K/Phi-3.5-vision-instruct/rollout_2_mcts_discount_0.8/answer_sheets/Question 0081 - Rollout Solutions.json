Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had initially before giving any away or using them. Initially, he had 10 stickers plus 21 new ones, which makes it 31 stickers (10 + 21). Then he received another 23 stickers as a gift, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers in total. Then, subtracting the stickers he gave away and those used, he gave away 9 and used 28 stickers. That means he used 9 + 28 = 37 stickers. Therefore, he has 54 - 37 = 17 stickers left.
