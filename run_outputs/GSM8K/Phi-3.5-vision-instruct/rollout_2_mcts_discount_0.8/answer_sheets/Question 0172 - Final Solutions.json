Using this info, let's consider condition 3 again because it involves Granny Red. If Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four (which means Granny Red would be 8x2=16), and considering granny Red should still follow all previous conditions mentioned above including being younger or same age as Sally Two; but, Sally Two was not explicitly defined yet like Granny Red or Sally Four, it implies that Sally Two could either be a new name for Granny Red just using different names for reference purposes since both can be 16 years old according to condition 3. This way, all four conditions can hold true simultaneously without contradiction. In conclusion, if Granny Red is 16 years old, and knowing that Granny Red cannot be older than Sally Two due to condition 2, hence Sally Two would also be around 16 years old too.
