First, calculate the net increase per year for Tom: he plants 10 trees but loses 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees annually.

Next, figure out the number of trees that died. Since 30% of the trees died, we can calculate this as follows: 30% death rate means 30/100 * 130 dead trees which equals 39 dead trees.

Firstly, we calculate the annual net increase which is 10 planted trees minus 2 cut trees, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year.

Adding these to the initial count of 50 trees, we find 50 + 80 = 130 trees before accounting for tree deaths.\n\nSubsequently, as per instructions provided, 30% of the trees died. To compute the number of surviving trees, first identify the quantity of dead trees, which is 30% of 130 trees. This results in 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees dying. Subtract this value from the sum prior to tree mortality. Thus, 130 trees - 39 dead trees equals 91 living trees remaining post-mortality.
