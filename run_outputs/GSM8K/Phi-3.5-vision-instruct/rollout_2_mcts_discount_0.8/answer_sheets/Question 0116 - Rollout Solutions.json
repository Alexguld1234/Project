That means out of every 20 units of these ingredients, 7 would be sugar. Since Katy uses a total of 120 units (teaspoons of sugar plus cups of water combined), and knowing that 7 parts represent 7 teaspoons of sugar per unit, we set up the following proportion: 7/20 = x/120. To find x, which represents the amount of teaspoons of sugar she used, we solve for x. So, x = (7 * 120) / 20 = 42. The answer is: 42.", "value": 0.75}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
