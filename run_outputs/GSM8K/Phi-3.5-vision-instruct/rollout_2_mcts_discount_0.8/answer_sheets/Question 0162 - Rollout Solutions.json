First, find out the increase per period: 20% of $20 is $4. Since the price increases every two months (a six-month interval), divide 36 months by 2 to get 18 periods of increase. Multiply the increase ($4) by the number of periods (18): 4 * 18 = $72. Finally, add the initial price plus all the increases together: $20 + $72 = $92.

Each time the price goes up by 20%, it means it becomes 120% of its previous value (because 100% + 20% = 120%). Therefore, we can write this as 1.2 times. We need to find out how many 2-month periods there are in 36 months. This is equal to 36 / 2 = 18 periods. Now, let's apply these multipliers over all those periods: \n\nInitial Price = $20.\nPrice after first period = Initial Price * 1.2 = $24.\nAfter second month = 24 * 1.2 = $28.80.\nAfter third month = 28.80 * 1.2 = $34.56.\n\nContinuing this pattern until the 18th month, we get:\n\nFinal Price = Initial Price * (1.2)^18 = $20 * (1.2)^18 = $119.57 approximately.\n\nSo if you round up to the nearest cent, a bag of marbles will cost $119.57 after 36 months.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
