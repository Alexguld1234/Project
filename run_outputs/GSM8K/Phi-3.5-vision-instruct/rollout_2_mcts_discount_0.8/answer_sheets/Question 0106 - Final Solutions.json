To get the inner dimensions, we need to subtract the thickness of one wall twice because it will cover two sides of the box. For example, for length: Length outside is 5 inches, so the length inside is 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches. For width: Width outside is 6 inches, so the width inside is 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches. For height: Height outside is 4 inches, so the height inside is 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches.", "2": "Calculate the volume of one inner box using its inner dimensions.
