To find out the total number of fruits in the clusters, we multiply the number of fruits per cluster (20) by the number of clusters (6), which equals 120. This means there are 120 fruits in the clusters. Additionally, there are 67 other individual fruits. Adding these together, we get 120 + 67 = 187 total raspberries in the bush.

Each cluster has 20 raspberries, so six clusters would have 6 times 20 which equals 120 raspberries.
