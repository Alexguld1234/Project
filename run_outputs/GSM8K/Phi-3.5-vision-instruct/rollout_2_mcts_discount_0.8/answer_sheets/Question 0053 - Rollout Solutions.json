First, calculate the revenue earned on Thursday: 6 truck tires at $60 each plus 4 car tires at $40 each equals (6*60) + (4*40). That means 360+160 which equals 520.\nNext, calculate the revenue earned on Friday: only car tires are being repaired, so it's just 12 car tires at $40 each. That amounts to 12*40, which equals 480.\nFinally, find out which day had the highest revenue. Since the revenues are 520 on Thursday and 480 on Friday, Thursday was the day with higher revenue.\nTo determine how much more revenue was made, subtract the smaller amount from the larger one: 520 - 480 = 40.\nSo the mechanic made $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
