After eating 2, Jean has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. Since Jean packages them into bags of 2, we need to find out how many full bags can be made from these lollipops. To do this, divide the remaining lollipops by the amount per bag: 28 / 2 = 14 bags. However, since only whole bags count as \"remaining,\" we don't consider partial packaging.
