We need to account for this net decrease. 80 (original amount) - 220 (used for coffee cups) = -140. Since we want only positive numbers representing how many post-it notes were in the purchase package, let\u2019s consider the negative result as a deficit. To find the actual number of Post-it notes in the package, we add back the deficit: -140 + 23 = -117. However, since it's not possible to buy a negative quantity of items, we can infer that something went wrong or was missed in our calculation. Perhaps the hint implies that if you subtract the usage from the original amount, and then add the remaining post-its, you would get the amount in the new package. Let\u2019s try again considering the remaining stock correctly: 80 (original amount) - 220 (spent) = -140, which indicates that there wasn\u2019t enough in the initial supply to cover the cost of the cups without depleting other resources.\n\nLet's reconsider what happened during the transaction process. It seems like when she bought the packaging containing new post-it notes, she gained enough additional supplies to replace those used for the coffee cups. Hence, she didn't go below zero but actually increased her available stock to make up for any loss incurred while buying the new batch. \n\nSo, considering both the initial shortage (-140) because of the expenditure on coffee cups and the subsequent surplus (+23), we must determine exactly what happened within these transactions. Essentially, the correct interpretation hinges upon understanding whether the negative deficit was indeed reflective of insufficient initial supplies or rather indicated an adjustment due to purchasing additional supplies. Given that it ends positively, we can infer that the deficit must have been covered by the new purchase.\n\nThus, by analyzing the sequence of events \u2013 starting with the original amount (80), subtracting what was used (220), reaching into negative territory (-140), ending with a small surplus (+23), we conclude that the net difference between what she initially had minus what was consumed plus what she obtained through her recent purchase equals to how many Post-it notes the package contained. Therefore, calculating the package contents involves reversing the negative situation by adding the deficit to her remaining stock: -140 (deficit) + 23 (remaining stock) = -117. But remember, this represents the increase needed just to return to the original amount, not necessarily indicating extra stock beyond the required replacement.\n\nTo obtain the exact number of Post-it notes in the package, we consider it as compensating for the immediate shortfall and supplying just enough to match the usage rate across all transactions including the purchase. Hence, the equation becomes: 80 (initial amount) - 220 (used for cups) + x (amount of package) = 23 (final remaining stock). Solving for 'x': x = 23 - (80 - 220); x = 23 - (-140); therefore, x = 163.
