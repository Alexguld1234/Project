Out of those, 3/4 went to one candidate (Condition 2), which is 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes. This means 60 votes were not left for the other candidate. To find out how many votes the losing candidate got, we subtract these 60 votes from the total number of votes cast. Therefore, 80 - 60 = 20 votes for the losing candidate.
