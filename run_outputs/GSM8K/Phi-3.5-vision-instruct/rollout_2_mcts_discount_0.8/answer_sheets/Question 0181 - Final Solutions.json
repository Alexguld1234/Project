We know that x represents the number of white carnations. Using this information, we can write three equations based on the relationships described in the problem statement:"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "1. Red roses are four times the amount of white carnations, so we can write this relationship as \\( R = 4x \\), where R represents the number of red roses.\n\n2. Pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations, so we can write this relationship as \\( C = 5x \\), where C represents the number of pink calla lilies.\n\n3. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, so we set up the equation \\( C = 200 \\). Substituting the value of C from above into this equation gives us \\( 5x = 200 \\). Solving for x will give us the number of white carnations. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get \\( x = \\frac{200}{5} = 40 \\).\n\nNow that we know x (the number of white carnations) is 40, we can find out how many red roses Sandra ordered by substituting x back into the first equation:\n\\( R = 4x \\)\n\\( R = 4 \\times 40 \\)\n\\( R = 160 \\)\n\nSo, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. Since no information about red roses being damaged or sold was provided, we assume all ordered roses are accounted for unless otherwise stated. Therefore, Fred must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to meet Sandra's demand.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery.
