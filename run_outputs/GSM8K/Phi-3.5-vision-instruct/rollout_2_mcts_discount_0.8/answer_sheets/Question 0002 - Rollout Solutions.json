Josh initially paid $80,000 for the house. He then invested an additional $50,000 into it. That makes the total cost $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. The value of the house went up by 150%, so its new value is $80,000 + ($80,000 * 150%) = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. To calculate the profit, subtract the total cost from the new value: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.
