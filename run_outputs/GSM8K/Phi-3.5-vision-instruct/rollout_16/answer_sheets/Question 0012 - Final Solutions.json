Firstly, we know that Carlos spends $3 annually to keep the tree healthy (watering and feeding), which means he needs at least 15 lemons to begin earning back those expenses alone because 15 lemons * $1.5 profit/lemon = $22.5 profit, which covers the $3 cost for three years without considering the cost of the tree itself. Beyond producing 15 lemons a year, any additional lemon produced will go towards covering the initial planting cost as well as beginning to turn a profit. Let L represent the number of lemons needed to reach the breakeven point including the initial cost. We establish our equation: 15L >= Initial Cost + Annual Profit. Knowing that L must be greater than or equal to 15, since 15 * $1.5 = $22.5, we can calculate the exact minimum number required to justify the planting of the tree: \n\n$90 (Initial Planting Cost) / $1.5 (Profit per lemon) = 60 lemons to cover the initial investment first. Thus, Carlos effectively breaks even when the revenue from lemons equals both the initial planting cost and the recurring costs. Given he gets $1.5 for each lemon sold, the minimum number of lemons to breakeven would be when the cumulative profit exceeds the cumulative losses over the same period. This complex calculation cannot simply add up costs and revenues; rather, we assess when the returns match the inputs, factoring in time and the continuous production cycle. Therefore, the exact breakeven point requires detailed financial analysis beyond simple arithmetic, often employing discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques that account for the changing value of future profits. Since we don\u2019t perform such calculations here, we can assert that Carlos starts earning once he produces more lemons than what he initially invested into the tree multiplied by the time frame considered.

Firstly, let's calculate the net gain or loss from selling the lemons every year. If Carlos gets 7 lemons for $1.5 each, that's 7 * 1.5 = $10.5. Subtracting the annual maintenance cost of $3, we get a profit of $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year. Secondly, since the initial planting cost was $90, we need to find out when Carlos breaks even. To do this, divide the initial investment by the annual profit: 90 / 7.5 = 12. Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money back on the lemon tree.

Calculating that gives us approximately 12.\n\nSo, according to these calculations, Carlos might think that within about 12 years he could start making profits off his lemon tree.
