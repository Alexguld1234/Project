Firstly, we know that John made $195 from selling the Lego sets because 13 sets times $15 per set equals $195. Next, let's find out how much money he spent on video games; since each game costs $20 and he bought 8, it would cost him 8 * $20 = $160. Since he ended up having $5 left over after buying the video games, this means he must have had $160 (spent) + $5 (left over) which equals $165 before making any purchases. Therefore, if he initially made $195 from selling the Lego sets, but needed only $165 to purchase the video games, the remaining money can be calculated as follows: $195 (initial sales) - $165 (spending on games) = $30. This difference represents the unaccounted value or the original amount of money he had before selling the Lego sets. Thus, John initially had $195 worth of value in his collection plus $30, which adds up to $225. Given that he sold all his Lego sets for $195, this confirms he began with those $195.
