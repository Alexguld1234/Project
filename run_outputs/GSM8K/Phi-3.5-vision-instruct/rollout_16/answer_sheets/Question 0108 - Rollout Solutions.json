Henry baked 110 cookies in total. Since we know he dropped 5 before putting them out to cool, let\u2019s subtract those first. 110 - 5 equals 105 cookies without any mishaps. Since this number represents what would have been twice as many as last year, which was supposed to be less (15 fewer), it means Henry was planning on baking only one third of the extra amount because 110 divided by 3 is roughly 37, but since he made 15 more, he baked exactly double that, meaning half of his planned amount was 15, so half of his planned amount is also 15. Therefore, he planned on making 30 cookies if no errors occurred. If he baked exactly double that intended amount, he would have 30 * 2 = 60 cookies planned, plus the 15 extra ones makes 75 cookies planned.
