Before her husband helped, she didn't have enough spoons because she used 3 while cooking. So if we subtract the 3 spoons she used, she would need 12 - (12 - 3) = 12 - 9 = 3 spoons initially.

Given this, Julia indeed bought the right amount of spoons based on the calculations above. Let's recheck our steps without assuming negative spoon counts.\n\nIf Julia finished with 12 spoons after receiving extra from her husband and using none during cooking, then before using any, she would have had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons. Considering that Julia ended up with just one less than the sum of her own and her husband's spoons, and knowing her husband contributed 5 spoons, we deduce that Julia initially had 15 - 5 = 10 spoons and her husband provided another 5, bringing their combined total to 10 + 5 = 15 spoons. This makes sense because it aligns with having exactly two fewer spoons than required once they had received all the spoons offered by their husbands.
