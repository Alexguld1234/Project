Since Carla normally downloads at 2 GB per minute and needs to download 200 GB, the download would typically take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes without any interruptions. However, since 40% of the time was spent installing updates (which took 20 minutes), the download actually went on for only 100 - 20 = 80 minutes before the restart.

Therefore, it will take another 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to download the rest of the file.
