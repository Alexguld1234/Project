We have:\n\nTotal Cars Available: 20\nAutomatic Cars: 12\nManual Cars: 4\n\nWe can calculate the semi-automatic cars like this: Total Cars - Automatic Cars - Manual Cars = Semi-Automatic Cars, which turns into 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars as before.\n\nNow, we want to find out what percentage of these 20 cars are semi-automatic. To get it, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100%.\n\nThis would look like this: (4 / 20) * 100% = 20%.
