Firstly, we need to find out how much water each girl gets when dividing it equally among themselves.

Therefore, 24 liters divided by 3 equals 8 liters per person. However, since only two girls are getting their fair share and the hint incorrectly states that each girl gets 1/6 instead of 1/3, let us correct this mistake.
