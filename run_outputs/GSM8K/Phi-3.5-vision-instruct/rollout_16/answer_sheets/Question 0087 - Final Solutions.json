Sylvie's original salary is $600 per month. That means $600 x 12 months = $7,200 annually. After one year (five years), her salary increases by 10%, so it becomes 7,200 + (7,200 * 0.1) = 7,920. After two additional years (a total of seven years), her salary again increases by 10%, making it 7,920 + (7,920 * 0.1) = 8,712. After another year (eight years), her salary rises once more by 10%, resulting in 8,712 + (8,712 * 0.1) = $9,583.20. However, we need to calculate only up until three more years of service, which would make it a total of 11 years since the beginning. Therefore, her salary after three more years of service is calculated as follows: 8,712 * 0.1 = 871.20.

So if Sylvie currently has an annual salary of $840 according to the hint, she has already received $840 / $7,200 = approximately 1/10th of the salary increment needed to reach $840.
