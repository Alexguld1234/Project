Thus, 49 / 4 equals 12.25. However, since you can't read half a page, we round down to the nearest whole number because if Solo reads less than 12.5 pages, he won't meet his goal within those 4 days. Therefore, the rounded answer would be approximately 12 pages. But remember our hint was correct; he only needed 34 pages in total to read, not 49. Hence, we get 34 / 4 = 8.5.
