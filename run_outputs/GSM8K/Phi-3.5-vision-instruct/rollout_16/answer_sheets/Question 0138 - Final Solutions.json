First, we calculate the amount of time Mark used during each test. For the first test, Mark took 7.33 hours (converted minutes) / 60 minutes = 0.122167 hours.

Next, we need to find out the maximum amount of time Mark could use on either test without surpassing their respective time limits. For the first test, the maximum possible duration without going overtime is 8 hours. Since Mark used less than 8 hours for the first test (0.67 hours), all the questions can be answered. For the second test, the maximum possible duration without going overtime is 6 hours. As Mark only used 5.5 hours, all the questions here too can also be answered.
