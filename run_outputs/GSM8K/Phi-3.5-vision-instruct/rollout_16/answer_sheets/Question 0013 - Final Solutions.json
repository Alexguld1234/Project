The total number of vacuum cleaners sold during these events equals 3+2+6.86\u22489.86, which rounds to approximately 10 when considering whole units only.

Let X be the initial number of vacuum cleaners.\n2. After selling one-third at the green house, we are left with (2/3)X.\n3. Selling two more reduces this to (2/3)X - 2.\n4. Selling half of what remains leaves us with (1/2)[(2/3)X - 2].\nConclusion: (1/2)[(2/3)X - 2] equals to 5. We can solve this equation to find out the value of X:\n(1/2)[(2/3)X - 2] = 5\n(1/2)*[(2/3)X - 2] = 5\n[(2/3)X - 2] / 2 = 5\n[2/3)X - 2] = 5 * 2\n[2/3)X - 2] = 10\n[2/3)X = 10 + 2\n[2/3)X = 12\nX = 12 * (3/2)\nX = 18\nMelanie initially had 18 vacuum cleaners before all the sales took place.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
