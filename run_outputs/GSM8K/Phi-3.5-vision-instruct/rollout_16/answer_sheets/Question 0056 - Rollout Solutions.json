However, since he can only spend whole dollars, he cannot afford to attend the movies twice because it would cost him $28 (2 trips), leaving him short of the $32 needed for four trips ($14/trip). Therefore, even though mathematically he could fit four trips into his budget, he can realistically only go once based on rounding down to account for partial trips not being possible without exceeding his budget. The hint provided suggests that there may be an error as 1) dividing 42 by 14 would give us exactly three complete trips, and 2) subtracting one less trip costs exactly what's needed for another trip plus a little extra. Thus, the answer appears to contradict the hint. Since hints suggest correct answers but often don't account for all scenarios or constraints, let's reevaluate under normal circumstances: Under regular conditions, Peter could indeed visit the movies up to 3 times before running out of money, so according to the rules here\u2014which seem to consider only full trips rather than partial ones\u2014the answer is 1 time.
