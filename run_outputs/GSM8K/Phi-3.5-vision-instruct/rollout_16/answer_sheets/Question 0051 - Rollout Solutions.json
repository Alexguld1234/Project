First, find out how far Tom's ship travels when he goes from point A to point B (from 1 to 4 PM) which is twice the interval because it spends the same amount of time going towards point B and returning.

Thus, to find the difference, subtract the initial one-way trip time from the new rounded time. That means 2 hours (the first trip duration from 1 to 4 PM) minus approximately 1.67 hours (the new calculated time), resulting in about 0.33 hours.

We can use the formula Distance equals Speed multiplied by Time (D=ST), where S is Speed and T is Time. For the first half, S=10 mph and T=3 hours (4 PM-1 PM); for the second half, S=6 mph and T=5 hours (12 AM-4 PM); therefore, D_1=10*3=30 miles; D_2=6*5=30 miles; Total distance is 30+30=60 miles.
