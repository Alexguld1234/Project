First, let's calculate the total time John spends running during the week based on condition 3. His longest run lasts 3 hours. Since the other two days are half as long, they each last 1.5 hours. Adding them together gives us a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours. Next, since we know the total distance covered is 60 miles, we can convert this into hours because we want to find the speed in miles per hour. Therefore, the average speed would be calculated using the formula Speed = Distance / Time. Here, the distance is 60 miles and the time is 6 hours.

Since he also runs longer on one day based on Condition 3, let's determine the distances for each run day. On the longest day (Condition 3), he runs 3 hours; thus, he covers 20 miles (total average). On the next long day (Condition 3), he runs half of 20 miles, or 10 miles. That leaves us with the shortest day where he must cover the rest of the 60 - 20 - 10 = 30 miles. Since all three days combined take up most of the week and he has fewer days running, his average running speed would be calculated over those three days, not just his shortest day alone. To calculate this, divide the total mileage (60) by the total days (7): 60 miles / 7 days = approximately 8.57 miles per day. However, if you want the daily average without considering the longer runs specifically, it remains as previously calculated: 20 miles per day since we do not have information about the actual length of each shorter run but rather their proportion relative to the longest run.
