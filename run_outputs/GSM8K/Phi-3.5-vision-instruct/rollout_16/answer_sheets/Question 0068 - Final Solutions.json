We know that there are twice as many boys as girls, which means for every girl, there are 2 boys.

Together, boys and girls make up a group of 180 students (60 girls + 120 boys). Since there are 5 students per teacher, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher (180 / 5) to determine the number of teachers needed. Doing this calculation yields 36. However, it seems like I made a mistake because the hint suggests that the result should not exceed the total student count divided by 5. Reevaluating the numbers, since there are exactly 120 boys, adding them to the existing 60 girls results in 180 students, which aligns perfectly when dividing by 5. Therefore, the number of teachers would still be calculated using the total student count divided by the ratio per teacher, resulting in a total of 36 teachers (as previously calculated).
