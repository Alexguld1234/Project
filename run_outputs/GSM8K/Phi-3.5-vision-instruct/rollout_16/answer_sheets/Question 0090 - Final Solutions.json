Question: How many pounds", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the amount of potato salad eaten by one child based on Condition 2. One child eats half the amount of potato salad as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 pounds, a child will eat 10/2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.", "2": "Calculate the amount of potato salad eaten by all children combined using the weight consumed by one child multiplied by the number of children. There are 5 children, so the total consumption by children is 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. According to Condition 1, if there are 20 adult dinosaurs, they would consume a total of 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad. For Condition 2, since children eat half what an adult eats, a child consumes 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad. With 5 children (Condition 3), their combined consumption amounts to 5 * 5 = 25 pounds. To find out how much potato salad is needed for both adults and children, add the consumption of adults and children together: 200 + 25 = 225 pounds.

Firstly, we know an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad. Secondly, a child eats half that amount because Condition 2 states so. Thus, one child consumes 5 pounds of potato salad.
