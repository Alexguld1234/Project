Blake runs back and forth 15 times over the length of the entire football field, which consists of \\( 100 \\text{ yards} \\) per segment.

Kelly's initial run covers half the length of the field before deciding against running alongside Blake. Her total distance calculation yields:\n\\[ \\text{Kelly's initial distance} = 2 \\times \\frac{100}{2} = 100 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\n3. Kelly continues with a different pattern: running to the 40-yard line (halfway point) and returning. This results in a shorter distance for each complete loop around the halfway point. Each full loop constitutes a quarter of the field length:\n\\[ \\text{Distance for each full loop} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25 \\text{ yards} \\]\nSince Kelly completes these loops 34 times, her additional distance is:\n\\[ \\text{Additional distance for Kelly} = 34 \\times 25 = 850 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\n4. To find out how much farther Kelly runs than Blake, add her initial distance to her additional distance and compare to Blake's total distance:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = (\\text{Kelly's initial distance} + \\text{Additional distance}) - \\text{Blake's total distance} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = (100 \\text{ yards} + 850 \\text{ yards}) - 3000 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 950 \\text{ yards} - 3000 \\text{ yards} \\]\n\nAs it turns out, Kelly actually runs fewer miles than Blake due to the change in her route after deciding against running along with him.

That would be 15 * (2 * 100) = 3000 yards.\n\nNow, let's calculate how far Kelly ran before deciding not to run as fast as Blake. Firstly, Kelly runs back and forth across the football field once. This means she covers 200 yards (100 yards going one way and another 100 yards coming back). So for the first part, Kelly covered 200 yards.\n\nThen, Kelly continues running but stops before reaching the other side. Instead of running all the way around the field, she chooses to go up to the 40-yard line and come back. So, she needs to cover halfway through the field plus double that because she goes both ways. Halfway of 100 yards is 50 yards, and since she comes back, it adds another 50 yards which makes 100 yards total. Thus, she covers an extra 50 yards.\n\nKelly then continues these steps for a total of 34 trips. So the additional 50-yard run happens 34 times. Therefore, she runs 50 * 34 = 1700 yards. Adding those miles to the initial 200 yards brings us to a total of 200 + 1700 = 1900 yards.\n\nFinally, we compare the distances. Blake ran 3000 yards while Kelly ran 1900 yards.
