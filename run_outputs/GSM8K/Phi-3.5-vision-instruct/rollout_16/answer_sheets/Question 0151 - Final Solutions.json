Shawna charged 25 cents per tire, which meant 5 bicycles x 2 tires x $0.25 = $<<5*2*0.25=2.5>>2.50 for the bicycles.\nNext, let's figure out the cost for the tricycle riders. Each tricycle needs three tires to be fully inflated, so the tricycle riders would pay 3 tires x $0.25/tire = $<<3*0.25=0.75>>0.75 per tricycle. With 3 people, this comes to 3 x $0.75 = $<<3*0.75=2.25>>2.25 for the tricycles.\nLastly, the rider who used only a unicycle didn't need any tire inflating services, so no additional revenue was earned from them.\nAdding everything together, Shawna made $2.50 (from bikes) + $2.25 (from tricycles) = $<<2.5+2.25=4.75>>4.75 for the whole day.
