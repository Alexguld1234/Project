Within this period, Julia rows back towards the shore. Since Julia rides at two liters per ten feet, we can calculate the amount of water she ingests based on the distance traveled and speed. We also know that the boat is filling up faster as the boat goes closer to the shore due to leaks. Let's assume that the rate of filling increases linearly over time (i.e., doubles). Therefore, we need to find the time required to fill the boat completely before reaching shore. The boat starts filling when Julia begins her journey, so let's call the time required to fill the boat completely T (in seconds), and the remaining time until shore is 64 - T. Since the filling rate doubles every second, we can write down the equation:\n\n2^T = 2 * 2^(64 - T)\nSolving the above equation, we get T = 32. This means it would take Julia 32 seconds to fully fill the boat if not for the leakage problem mentioned earlier. However, since she only takes 64 seconds overall to reach the shore, the boat doesn't actually fill up completely within those 64 seconds. Instead, it fills up partially. By dividing the total time into sections of equal length, we can estimate the partial fillup during Julia's ride. If the boat filled up completely in 32 seconds and Julia rows continuously, we divide 64 by 32, which equals approximately 2/3 or 64 divided by 32 is approximately 2 times. Thus, the boat fills up approximately twice its initial capacity. To determine the exact amount of water ingested, we multiply half of its initial capacity (which corresponds roughly to the partial fillup factor of 2) by the partial time frame (which is about 2/3 of the entire travel time). This amounts to approximately: 2 / 3 * 2 * 2 liters per 10 feet = 2 * 4 / 3 * 10 feet = 8 liters. Therefore, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on approximately 8 liters of water. The answer is: 8.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
