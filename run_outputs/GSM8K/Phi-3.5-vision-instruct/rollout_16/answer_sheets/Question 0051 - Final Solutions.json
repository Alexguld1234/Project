The distance traveled each hour is still unknown. However, the problem states that Tom's ship can travel at 10 mph and he sails from 1 to 4 PM. Therefore, assuming one hour equals 60 miles as mentioned earlier, in four hours his ship travels a distance of 4 x 60 = 240 miles. At night, the ship travels at 6 mph. Using the same logic above, if the journey lasts 4 hours then nighttime hours add another 4 x 6 = 240 miles. Thus, in total, the journey covers 240 + 240 = 480 miles. The ratio of daytime/nighttime hours is therefore equal to 8 hrs/16 hrs which simplifies into 1/2 or .5 meaning half of each leg takes place during daylight hours whereas other half takes place during darkness (or vice versa depending upon starting point). Given that total length remains unchanged regardless whether half occurs during daylight hours vs darkness then original question posits roughly equivalent lengths covered during each respective period despite different rates involved thus yielding identical overall outcome whatever method used calculating ratios applied onto known quantities present therein equation becomes: 240 / (.5 * 60)+(240 / (.5 * 60)) = 240 / 45+240/45 = 240 / 65+240/65 = 240/65+240/65 = 480/65\u22487.4, round up yields ~8 hours.

So, we divide the whole trip into two parts: the first part, which lasts until 4 PM, takes longer than the second part, which takes shorter. We can use the formula Distance equals Speed multiplied by Time (D=ST), where S is Speed and T is Time. For the first half, S=10 mph and T=3 hours (4 PM-1 PM); for the second half, S=6 mph and T=5 hours (12 AM-4 PM); therefore, D_1=10*3=30 miles; D_2=6*5=30 miles; Total distance is 30+30=60 miles. To find the total time taken for the entire trip, we add up the times from both legs: T_total=3+5=8 hours.

First, let's consider the distance Tom traveled in the first part of his journey. Assuming he sailed for exactly one hour, he would cover 10 miles because his speed was 10 miles per hour. For the return trip at 6 miles per hour over the same 10 miles, dividing the distance by the new speed gives us 10 miles / 6 miles/hour = roughly 1.67 hours, which translates to about 100 minutes rounded up. The extra 33 minutes beyond what you expect (60 minutes), could indicate either additional sailing time due to slower speeds caused by other factors such as wind resistance or simply an estimation error based on rounding the fractional portion of the result to represent whole numbers better. However, considering only the calculated values without outside assumptions, the correct calculation indicates a duration of 100 minutes for returning home.
