Since he ended up having $5 left over after buying the video games, this means he must have had $160 (spent) + $5 (left over) which equals $165 before making any purchases. Therefore, if he initially made $195 from selling the Lego sets, but needed only $165 to purchase the video games, the remaining money can be calculated as follows: $195 (initial sales) - $165 (spending on games) = $30.

Since he ends up having $5, it means he spent $195 (total sales) - $160 (video game cost) = $35. However, this doesn't make sense because his total earnings can't decrease, not accounting for any initial investment or losses before selling. This suggests there might be a mistake in interpreting the hint provided. It seems like the total expenses on video games shouldn't subtract directly from the total revenue but rather consider what remains after buying the video games. Therefore, since every purchase is independent, let's consider just the earnings first. As previously calculated, John's earnings from selling the Lego sets would remain constant regardless of other transactions as long as no additional purchases were made. Hence, without information about further expenditures beyond the video games, one cannot determine how many Lego sets John has left solely based on the sales; only knowing whether these funds were utilized for other purposes or kept aside post-sale could provide insight into remaining Lego sets. Given the current scenario, the number of Lego sets John has left isn't calculable due to lack of complete data regarding his subsequent actions with the revenue.\n\nHowever, answering strictly within the parameters of the original prompt while disregarding external variables, John still possesses 13 Lego sets initially, as the question of how many sets he has left after all transactions depends solely on the number of units sold\u2014and he began with 13.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 5}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
