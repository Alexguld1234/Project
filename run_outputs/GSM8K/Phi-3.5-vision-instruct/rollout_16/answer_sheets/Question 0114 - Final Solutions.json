Firstly, we know Jamal's phone holds 1800 photographs which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs. Next, Brittany's phone can also store photos equal to 50 times more bird images than the ones in Jamal's photo. Since both capacities (for Jamal and Brittany) relate to birds as one quantity, let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photo as B. Hence, 300 = 50B.

So, 300 / 50 = B, meaning B = 6.\n\nNow, remembering our hint about the actual content of Brittany's phone \u2013 i.e., the storage capacity being equivalent to the number of birds seen in Jamal's photograph, it implies if Brittany's phone can accommodate 50 times more birds than those in Jamal\u2019s photo, the number of birds in Jamal's photo equals 1/50th of what Brittany's phone can hold.
