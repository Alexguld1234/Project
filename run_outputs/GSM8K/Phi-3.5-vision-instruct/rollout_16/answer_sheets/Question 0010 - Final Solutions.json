To find out what this decrease looks like, calculate 30% of the second month's amount and subtract it from the second month's value. Since the third month's count cannot be less than zero or negative, we just reduce it proportionally based on the percentage mentioned: 180 * (1 - 0.30) = 180 * 0.70 = 126 downloads.\nNow let's sum up all the downloads over these three months: First month's 60 downloads + Second month's 180 downloads + Third month's 126 downloads equals a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.\nThe answer is: 366.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

In the second month, downloads tripled so we calculate it as 60 * 3. That's 180.\n\nNow let's find out about the third month. Since downloads decreased by 30%, we need to figure out what 30% of the second month\u2019s downloads amount to. First, convert 30% into a decimal form: 30/100 = 0.3. Next, multiply this by the number of downloads in the second month: 180 * 0.3 = 54. Subtracting this value from the second month\u2019s total gives us the number of downloads for the third month: 180 - 54 = 126.\n\nFinally, add up all these amounts together to get the total number of downloads over the three months: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) equals 366.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is: 366.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
