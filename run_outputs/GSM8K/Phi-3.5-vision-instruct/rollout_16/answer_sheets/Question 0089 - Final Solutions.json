Since 1/4 of the people won't come, we need to determine what happens when you subtract 1/4 from 1 whole, which represents all the invites sent out. We take the total number of friends invited, which is 16, and apply the fraction of those who didn't show up (which is 1/4).

Thus, multiplying 12 guests by 0.75 gift bags per guest yields 9 gift bags needed. Finally, knowing that each gift bag costs $2, we can determine the total expense by multiplying the quantity of bags (9) by their individual price ($2), thus arriving at a total cost of 9 * 2 = $18.
