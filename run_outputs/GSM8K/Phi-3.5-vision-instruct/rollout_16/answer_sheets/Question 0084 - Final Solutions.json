Team plays 22 games, so if they won 8 more than they lost, let's say the team won 'W' games and lost 'L' games. According to this scenario, W = L + 8. And since the total number of games is 22, we can write another equation: W + L = 22. Substituting W from the first equation into the second equation, we get (L+8) + L = 22. Simplifying it, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Solving for L, we find L = 7. Therefore, W = L + 8 = 15.
