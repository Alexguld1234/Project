Hence, taking into account possible overlapping periods when additional cleaning could occur, even though not mentioned in the problem, let\u2019s consider its maximum potential uses, which still remains at least one time due to lack of information regarding any extra cleanings required outside of classes. Thus, the maximum number of times the whiteboard likely needs to be cleaned is also one. So, considering all conditions, the answer ranges between one to possibly three cleanings.
