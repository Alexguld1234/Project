Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, and the distance is 3 miles or 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet. So Steve takes 15,840 / 440 = 35.7 minutes to reach the school. Tim rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute over a distance of 2 miles or 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet. Thus, Tim takes 10,560 / 264 = approximately 40.2 minutes to get to the school.
