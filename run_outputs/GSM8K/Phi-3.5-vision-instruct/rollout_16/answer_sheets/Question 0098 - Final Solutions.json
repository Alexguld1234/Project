There were originally 30 cars on the motorway. If we subtract the 5 cars that took an exit, this leaves 25 cars still in the traffic jam. Out of these 25 cars, 20 drove through during the next 15 minutes. So, 25 - 20 = 5 cars would be left if no other cars joined or left. But since only one car drives off every minute over the course of the 15 minutes it takes for all cars to leave, that means 1 car per minute multiplied by 15 minutes equals 15 cars.
