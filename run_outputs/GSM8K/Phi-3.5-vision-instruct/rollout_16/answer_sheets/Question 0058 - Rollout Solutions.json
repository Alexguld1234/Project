Let's first find out what the 25% fee alone amounts to before adding it to the delivery charges. If the 25% fee represents 25% of the total original amount (before the delivery fee), we can write this as a proportion or equation. The delivery fee itself ($3.00) doesn't count towards the percentage fee calculation. We need to isolate the 25% portion excluding the $3.00 delivery fee. Here's how we calculate it:\n\nWe know that when you add the 25% fee to the $3.00 delivery fee, the total comes to $40.00. To find just the 25% fee part, let's subtract the delivery cost first, which makes our new base amount $37.00 ($40 - $3). Next, to get back to the full $40 (including the $3 delivery charge), we increase this $37 by $3, making up again the whole $40. This means that the original base amount including the $3 delivery fee but without the 25% fee was exactly $37. Since the $3 delivery charge represented the other 25%, we can deduce that the remaining 75% must represent the value of $40 minus $3 worth of goods plus the 25% fee. Therefore, if the current bill (excluding the $3 delivery fee but already including the 25%) sums up to $37, then the 25% fee must account for the difference between $40 and $37. Calculating 25% of $37 gives us:\n\n0.25 \u00d7 37 = $9.25.\n\nThus, the fee adds $9.25 onto the final bill without considering the delivery cost.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {"1": "Finally, to include the $3 delivery fee along with the $9.25 fee, we simply sum them all up:"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
