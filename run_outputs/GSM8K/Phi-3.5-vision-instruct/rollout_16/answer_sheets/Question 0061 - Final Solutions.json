Firstly, we know from Condition 1 that Janet spent $500 on raw materials. From Condition 2, we know that she paid $800 for the jeweler's services. To find out the total before taxes, we simply sum these up: $500 (raw materials) + $800 (jeweler's fee) equals $1300. The answer is: 1300.", "value": 0.7}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the total amount Janet paid including its creation, construction, and insurance?", "subanswer": {"text": "Insurance fees are calculated as 10% of the combined value of the material costs ($500) and the jeweler's fee ($800), which is 10% of $1300. This results in an insurance payment of 0.10 * $1300 = $130. Adding the initial $1300 to the $130 insurance fee totals $1300 + $130 = $1430. The answer is $1430.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
