Firstly, we know that Katy uses 7 teaspoons of sugar per cup of water. There are 13 cups of water so it would be 7*13 = 91 teaspoons of sugar. However, since she used a total of 120 items (both tea and water), if all were made up of tea we can subtract these 91 teaspoons of sugar which leaves us with 120 - 91 = 29 items. Therefore out of those 29 items only 91/29 = 3.12 are teaspoons of sugar per item because you cannot use fractional teaspoons. So 29 * 3 = 87 teaspoons of sugar. But wait! We already counted 91 teaspoons above... Let\u2019s look again.\n\nWe see that if every unit was made up of tea (i.e., no water) then Katy could indeed make exactly 91 teaspoons of sugar as calculated before. But here, we are told that there are a total of 120 units, consisting of both tea and water. The question asks specifically about the number of teaspoons of sugar used. And since water doesn\u2019t contain any sugar, we ignore it entirely in our calculation. Thus, Katy used precisely 91 teaspoons of sugar \u2013 not 87 or 29. \n\nIt seems there might have been a mistake somewhere along the way. Let me retry the calculations carefully this time.\n\nFirst off, let's consider the ratio once more. Given the ratio of 7:13, one whole cycle of both components amounts to 7+13=20 units. This means each unit within the total of 120 consists of 120/20 = 6 of such cycles.\n\nThis implies that 7 teaspoons of sugar (pertaining to the '7' component) multiplied by 6 full cycles yields 7*6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar; and similarly, 13 cups of water yield another 13*6 = 78 cups.\n\nIn total, Katy would therefore have consumed 42 + 78 = 120 items.\n\nHowever, note that while calculating the amount of teaspoons of sugar alone, we neglected other variables like the weight or volume capacity limit of the container holding them.

We know from Condition 2 that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. To find out how many parts sugar we need, let\u2019s divide the total number of teaspoons by this sum, which would represent all the parts in the mixture, i.e., 7+13=20 parts. Then, dividing the original amount of teaspoons by these 20 parts would give us one part size, or: 120/20 = 6 teaspoons per part.
