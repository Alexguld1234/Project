First, find out Dana's running speed based on the skipping information.

Therefore, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.\nNext, let's figure out how long she'll spend running and walking over those six hours. She spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking.

Walking at 3 miles per hour for 4 hours gets us 3 * 4 = 12 miles.\nFinally, summing both distances for the entire 6 hours yields 12 miles (running) + 12 miles (walking) = 24 miles.
