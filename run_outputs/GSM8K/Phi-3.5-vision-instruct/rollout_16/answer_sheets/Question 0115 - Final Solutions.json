She bought one type of board for $10 each and another type for $16 each. We don't know how many of each she bought, but we can assume she bought 'x' units of the first type of board and 'y' units of the second type. Initially, she spent (x * $10) + (y * $16) dollars on lumber.\n\nSecondly, let's calculate the total initial value of Sasha's lumber: Assuming equal amounts of both types as per previous hint, which means Sasha bought 5x of the $10 boards and 5y of the $16 boards. This totals to (5x * $10) + (5y * $16) = (50x) + (80y) dollars. But without knowing the exact values of 'x' and 'y', it's impossible to directly compute the exact initial cost or the adjusted total value.\n\nNow looking into the profit calculation post selling all the leftover lumber considering the 50% increase in prices; if she sells everything including the $16 boards at the increased rates, the total revenue would be ((50x + 80y + 5 * $16)) * 1.5 (considering 50% increase across all items). But again, without specific quantities of each type of lumber, precise calculation isn't possible.\n\nAs such detailed information regarding the quantity of individual types of lumber purchased cannot be derived from the provided instruction.
