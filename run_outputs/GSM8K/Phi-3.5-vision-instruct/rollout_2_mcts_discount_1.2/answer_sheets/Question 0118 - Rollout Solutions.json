On the first day, we know about 2 containers containing 5 vehicles each, which totals 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. We also know the combined total number of vehicles on the second day was 30. To find out the number of containers on the second day, subtract the original 10 vehicles from the total of 30 vehicles. This means that on the second day, there were 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the total number of vehicles (20) by the number per container (5), getting 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

Initially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles which equals 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles. This means before any new containers arrived, the total was also 10 vehicles.
