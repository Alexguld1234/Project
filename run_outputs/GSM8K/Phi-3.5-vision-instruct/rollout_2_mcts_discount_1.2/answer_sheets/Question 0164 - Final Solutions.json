Firstly, we need to calculate the potential earnings lost when Jackie does her own taxes, which is 3 hours multiplied by her hourly rate of $35, equalling $105. Next, consider the fee charged by the accountant, which is $90. Comparing these two amounts reveals that hiring an accountant leaves Jackie with $105 (lost due to doing her taxes) minus $90 (the cost of the accountant), resulting in a savings of $15.
