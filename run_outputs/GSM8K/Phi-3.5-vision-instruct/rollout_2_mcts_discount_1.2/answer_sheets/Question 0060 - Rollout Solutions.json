One bad orange means we don't consider them when counting the good ones. We start with 3 oranges and remove one because it's bad, leaving 2 oranges. Out of these 2 oranges, 20% would mean 20/100 * 2 = 0.4, which rounds up to 1 due to not having partial oranges. But remember, those that taste sour are also excluded. Subtracting the sour oranges, we get 1 - 1 = 0 good oranges. The hint suggests considering the sourness, implying all non-bad oranges could potentially be sour. Since none of the remaining non-bad oranges are marked as sour, we assume all except the two already accounted for are good. Therefore, no additional subtraction is needed beyond what was stated earlier. Thus, there are no 'good (ripe and sweet)' oranges left if we strictly follow the instructions without further information about other oranges possibly being sweeter than the first batch.
