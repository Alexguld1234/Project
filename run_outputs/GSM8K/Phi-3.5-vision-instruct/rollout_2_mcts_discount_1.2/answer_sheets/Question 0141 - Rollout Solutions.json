Then, since there are twice as many baby bees (B) as queens, B = 2Q. Since there are twice as many workers (W) as babies, W = 2B. We know that Q + B + W = 700. Substituting B and W, we get Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700, or 7Q = 700. Solving for Q, we find that Q = 700 / 7 = 100. To find the number of babies, B = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200. Answer 5.1: There are 200 baby bees.", "value": 0.4}, "ost_step": {"1": "Next, let's solve for the number of worker bees. As before, B = 2Q, so B = 2 * 100 = 200. But wait! The question asks about worker bees not babies. We made an error because our solution only found the number of baby bees. This means we need to correct it.", "2": "We know W = 2B and B = Q / 2 or W = Q. Since we still don\u2019t have enough information to solve this system of equations directly, one way to simplify would be setting up another equation based on the total count of bees.", "3": "Total bees can also be represented as Q + B + W. But since W = Q, then the above simplifies down to 2Q + Q + Q = 700. Simplifying further, we get 4Q = 700. Solving for Q yields us Q = 175, thus B = 175/2 = 87.5 rounded off becomes 88. Now using W = Q, we substitute and find W = 88. Finally, we find the total number of worker bees to be W = 88. Thus, we have 88 = W.
