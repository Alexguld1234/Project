The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, so let's say Darrell is 7x years old and Allen is 11x years old. Together, their current combined age is 7x + 11x which equals 162. Thus, we get 18x = 162. To find x, divide both sides by 18, resulting in x = 9. So currently, Allen is 11x which means 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

First we need to find out what Allen's current age is using the given ratio of 7:11 for Darrell and Allen's ages. We know that together they add up to 162. Let the common factor for their ages be 'x'. So we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. Dividing both sides by 18, we find x = 9. Therefore, Allen\u2019s current age is 11 * 9 = 99. To predict Allen's age 10 years into the future, all we need to do is add 10 years to his current age which gives us 99 + 10 = 109.
