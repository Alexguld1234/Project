This means Sally Four also is 8 years old."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's identify the ages of Sally Four (which is also Sally Thirtytwo) and Granny Red. We already established that both Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are 8 years old. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four or Thirtytwo; thus, Granny Red is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.\n\nNow all we need to do is add up these ages together along with the original bird ages if applicable. However, no initial age was given for the birds, so this part doesn't apply here. Summing only the human ages results in 8 (Sally Four/Thirtytwo) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) which equals 43. Therefore, the total combined age is 43 years among humans.\n\nThe question about the birds didn't provide any additional information regarding them, therefore, we cannot include their ages in our sum. The answer is: 43 (among humans).", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
