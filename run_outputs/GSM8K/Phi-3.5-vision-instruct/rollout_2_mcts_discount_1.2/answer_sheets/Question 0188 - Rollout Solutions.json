First we need to find out the cost price per bag including transportation. It was $20 plus $2 which makes $22 per bag. If the trader made $400 as profit after selling at $30 each, this means he sold (30 - 22) = $8 worth of profits per bag. To make a profit of $400, the number of bags sold would therefore be $400 / $8 = 50 bags. The answer is: 50.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
