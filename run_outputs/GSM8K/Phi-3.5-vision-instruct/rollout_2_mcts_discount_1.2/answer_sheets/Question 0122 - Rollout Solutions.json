On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours. For Tuesday and Wednesday (the next two days), she slept 2 hours less. That means she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours on both days. So in total for these three days, she slept 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours. For the remaining four days of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the last two days. That would mean she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day. Therefore, for these four days, she slept 7 * 4 = 28 hours. Adding up all the hours together, we get 20 + 28 = 48 hours. The answer is: 48.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
