Not doing the taxes herself means Jackie loses out on 3 hours of work multiplied by her hourly rate ($35) which equals $105. So instead of losing $105, she spends $90 on the accountant. That means she'll actually save $105 - $90 = $15. However, this saving doesn't take into account any other factors like time and stress. So, without these considerations, the direct monetary comparison shows that it would cost Jackie $15 less by hiring the accountant.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
