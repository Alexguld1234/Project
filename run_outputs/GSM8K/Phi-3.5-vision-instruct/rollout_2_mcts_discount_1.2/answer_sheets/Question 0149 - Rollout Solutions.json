We start with knowing that Charlie has 12 friends which corresponds to having three times as many as Dorothy. To find out how many friends Dorothy has, divide Charlie\u2019s friend count by three: 12 / 3 = 4. Now, considering James who has four times as many friends as Dorothy, multiply the latter's amount by four: 4 * 4 = 16.
