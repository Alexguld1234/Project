Therefore, Darrell's age is 7x, and Allen's age is 11x. Their combined age is 7x + 11x = 18x. We know they sum up to 162 years, hence 18x = 162. Solving for x yields x = 162 / 18 = 9. Thus, Allen\u2019s current age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99 years old. The answer is 99.", "value": 0.4}, "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate Allen's age ten years from now. This would simply be 99 (current age) + 10 = 109.", "2": "Confirm if this result makes sense within the context of the given information."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we need to find out what Allen's current age is using the given ratio of 7:11 for Darrell and Allen's ages. We know that together they add up to 162. Let the common factor for their ages be 'x'. So we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. Dividing both sides by 18, we find x = 9. Therefore, Allen\u2019s current age is 11 * 9 = 99. To predict Allen's age 10 years into the future, all we need to do is add 10 years to his current age which gives us 99 + 10 = 109. It fits perfectly because it aligns with our initial hint calculation as well.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
