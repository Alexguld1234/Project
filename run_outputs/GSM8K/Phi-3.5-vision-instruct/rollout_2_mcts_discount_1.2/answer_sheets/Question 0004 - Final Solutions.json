Firstly, we know that each chicken gets 3 cups of feed in a whole day (morning + afternoon). Since it\u2019s a daily routine, this amount doesn't change throughout the day. Secondly, since she needs to distribute these 3 cups equally among the 20 chickens for each of the three meals, no matter what time of day, she would still use up exactly 3 cups per chicken every meal which sums up to a total of 9 cups per chicken over the course of one day. Therefore, irrespective of when those meals happen or even if they are divided into 3 different instances, as long as you have 3 parts of equal size, you can divide them any way you like. Thus, for each individual chicken, the final meal could be either morning, afternoon, or evening and the amount of feed required will remain constant.\nThus, the number of cups needed for a single meal remains 3 cups for each chicken regardless of the time of day. So for the entire flock, it'd be 3 cups multiplied by 20 chickens, equalling 60 cups.\nNote however, that the total calculation actually assumes that Wendi prepares the feeding quantities only once during the day rather than separately for each instance of the feedings. So while the math states that she feeds her chickens twice with 3 cups a time, technically speaking, she feeds them just once overall but spread out over the period of the day according to her chosen schedule.\nTherefore, the actual total number of cups of feed remaining for her chickens would be 60 minus the summed total of morning and afternoon, i.e., 60 - 15 - 25 = 60 - 40 = 20 cups.
