Each adult dinosaur needs 1 pound of potato salad, so 20 adults would require 20 * 1 = 20 pounds. Children eat half as much as adults, which means each little dinosaur will eat about 0.5 pounds. Since there are 5 children, this amounts to 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 pounds. Adding the amount needed for adults and children together, 20 + 2.5 equals 22.5 pounds.

First, we determine what a child eats: since an adult eats 10 lbs and a child eats half that amount, a child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. Next, calculate the total consumption for all children: 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs. Add this to the total consumption for all adults: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs. Combine both amounts: 25 lbs (children) + 200 lbs (adults) = 225 lbs. The answer is: 225.", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
