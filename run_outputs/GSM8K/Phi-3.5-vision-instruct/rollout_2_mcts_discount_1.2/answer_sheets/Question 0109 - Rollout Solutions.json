First, we need to calculate the cost of filling up 10 gallons without any discount. Since the price is $3.00 per gallon, it will cost 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00. Next, we apply the $0.20 cashback per gallon to find out the savings from cashback. Savings can be calculated as 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00. Finally, subtract the savings from the original cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00. The answer is: $28.00.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
