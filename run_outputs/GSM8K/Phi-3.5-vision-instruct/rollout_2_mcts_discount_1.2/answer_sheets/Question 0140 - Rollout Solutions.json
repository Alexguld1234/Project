Out of 20 cars, we know that 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, so these account for 12 + 4 = 16 cars. This leaves us with 20 - 16 = 4 semi-automatic cars. To find out what percentage this represents, divide the number of semi-automatic cars (4) by the total number of cars (20), and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. That would be (4/20) * 100 = 20%. So the answer is: 20%.", "value": 0.96875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
