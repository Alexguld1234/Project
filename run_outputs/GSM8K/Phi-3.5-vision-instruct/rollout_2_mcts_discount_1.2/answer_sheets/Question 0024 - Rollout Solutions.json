We know Kyle paid $19.50 which is 75% (100% - 25%) of the original price because of the discount. To find the original price, we can set up the equation: 0.75 * Original Price = $19.50. Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26. Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

Kyle paid $19.50 after getting a 25% discount. That means the price was reduced by 25%. To find out what the original price was before the discount, we need to divide the sale price by (1 - the discount rate). The calculation would look like this: Original Price = Sale Price / (1 - Discount Rate) or Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25). First calculate the denominator: 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Next, divide the sale price by this amount: $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.

That means the original price without the discount would be $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26. The hint says the answer is $26, so it matches our calculation.
