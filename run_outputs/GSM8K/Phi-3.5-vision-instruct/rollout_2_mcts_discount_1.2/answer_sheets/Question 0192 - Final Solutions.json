Each year, he increases the count by planting 10 but decreases it by chopping down 2, so net increase per year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.\nAfter 10 years, without considering death, he would have increased his tree count by (10*8) = 80 trees. This makes a new total of 50 + 80 = 130 trees. However, we know that 30% of them die off which means 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees are killed. Hence, the remaining trees amount to 130 - 39 = 91 trees.
