Firstly, we need to convert miles into feet. Steve is 15840 feet from the school and Tim is 10560 feet from the school. Next, calculate time it takes for each student to reach home.

First, we need to find out how long it takes each one of them to get to school. For Steve, it took 35 minutes as calculated earlier. For Tim, let's find out how far he travels when biking at 264 feet per minute for a certain amount of time. Let x be the time it takes for Tim. Since he lives 2 miles away, which equals 10560 feet, and he bikes at 264 feet per minute, we can write the equation x * 264 = 10560. Solving this equation, we find x = 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.
