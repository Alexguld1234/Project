Since we can only use whole numbers due to lacking fractional cents denominations (assumption made here), since .12 closer to zero when compared against other amounts would instead result as being priced below one cent ($1) if strictly going beyond basic currency representation limitations imposed within US systems hence ,begonia too gets rounded to$2.\r",
