Subtracting them from the general citizenry, we get 23786 (total citizens) - 17509 (grown ups) leaves us with 6277 remaining residents \u2013 hence it equates to all kid residents present within their confines. Therefore, childhood remains prevalent among approximately six thousand seven hundred seventy-seven individuals residing underneath its sunlit canopy and breezy skies hereinafter referred as 'children'.

As such this difference equates directly into child figures \u2013 thus subtracting one subgroup value ('Adult') from parental populace yields us results belonging strictly within another subdivision represented through remaining demographic constituents\u2013which happens always whenever numerical computations involve segregation amongst different strata representing varying societal segments based off certain criteria like age range , gender etc..
