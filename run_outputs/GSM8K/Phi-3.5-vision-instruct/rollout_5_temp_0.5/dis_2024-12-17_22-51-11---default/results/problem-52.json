However if the task was asking how many toys he would NOT have needed to take out assuming nothing else was taken off but not considering here what happened next because everything fell apart :) To clarify your question could I ask specifically about removing the mentioned items i.e., Comics or Toys rather than generalities around 'weights', please provide clearer instruction regarding which item(comics & toys) requires removal so calculation may proceed properly ;) thanks !! :D Yes sure! Let\u2019s try again under my assumption above.. Comical Books Are Needed To Be Removed As They Exceed Allowed Weight Allowance. Firstly let us find out the collective value of said Objects.

As uriah wants to reduce another 7.5 pounds from his current load, knowing every toy weighing 1/2 pound helps identify how many can remain. Therefore, divide 7.5 /(1/2). We get this simplified equation equal to ((7.5)/(1/2))=15; therefore Uriah requires removal of exactly fifteen additional half-pound items or twelve complete light objects like stuffed animals etc., which altogether make up one third less than twenty whole ones!
