Your original request focused directly ONLY on calculating numbers based exclusively on provided data rather than forming additional complex queries about possible cost savings involving health insurance benefits among different scenarios. To adhere strictly to such detailed calculations without diving into any further analysis or comparisons regarding costs might simplify tasks but simultaneously omit potential educational discussions around financial prudence strategies related to employer contributions toward employee expenses like deductibles not covered under standard plan premiums.

Next up it was asked about coaching; likewise, calculate earning as a coach first. As Jill receives $30 when serving students or clients every single class which lasts for 1 hour i.e., takes place once during such course period, hence monthly payment comes down to 1hr*30$=$<<1*30=30>>30$. This sum multiplied into times offered sessions in specific months makes us come across amount charged annually :   30 $/month * 12 Months /Year * Coach Role Salary During One Year =~ <<(30)*12*(1)=360>>360 $. Therefore finally combining above mentioned amounts together equals actual combined paycheck received due both job roles all gathered around throughout certain time frame within past considered here. That would add them back again adding taken parts thus resulting completely calculated overall compensation worth exactly ~ $38,360 altogether .

Here 'm' stands for amount earned playing baseball, which means when only one sport played; leaving us here with equation set below.(Remembering c=d/e so f needs no change):   ![image](https://mycosmoist.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/algebraic-equations_solved-via-cramer%E2%80%99s-%E2%8B%AFnewtons-method_final.jpg?)<|end_of_document|>(NOTICE THAT BOTH LHS AND RHS SHOULD BE POLYNOMIAL MULTIPLICATION OUTPUT! )So since our goal would remain same but variable names changed lets call sports differently instead:- soccer --> math -- algebra-->f--->z ;,- swimming.--physics----g ;and---handball-.

And since it said jIll worked this full time throughout those years \u2013 meaning no breaks came during all of these months -- so just multiply both values together; hence, the amount of income earned annually becomes equal to $(700) times the entirety(i.e., whole period)=$24,500.(For Teaching only). We also need to calculate additional payments received through coaching activities separately before arriving at combined sum i.e.. Here we go! When working part-time (in our case 15 Hours/Week): Multiply your Rate Per Unit Work ($30 /hr.) By Number Of Units Works ((Hrs Worked* ) Week); This equals= $450 . However remember ,this value represents one particular week or session ..Not necessarily every possible Sunday Night Session may not happen exactly once a month...That being stated :Now consider any span over few sessions taken place within specific calendar quarters like Q4 [October --- December ] ...You could expect something around ; say maybe about:(rough guesses?)

As a cheerleading coach, Jill makes $30 per hour while dedicating 15 hours every week which totals up to 30*15= $450 spent on coaching per week. Annually, when you multiply it over a span of 50 work weeks, we obtain 450*50=$22,500 earned through cheerleading sessions. Combining both roles sums up to being equivalent or greater than just picking one job hence adding them together results into getting back our original amount i.e.,  35,000+$22,500 equals roughly equal to about $57,500 annually before taking taxes out; thereby concluding off here. Thus overall income can reach close enough figures based upon specific fiscal situations including deductions & other variables apart form mere base calculations but ultimately comes down toward similar numbers if taken directly according provided context details!
