        " Sarah wants a used one which depreciates annually based on its age (in years) times the purchase price divided by million. Therefore if we let 'x' represent the yearly rate this means Sarah would pay x/year*(price)/million or simply ((x*purchase_price))/(Millions). Given that annual depreciation doubles every three years; hence it can also expressed as twice(depreciation)^t , Where _______ represents millions of dollars and t stands for time taken into consideration i.e., years passed since the purchase . We know when purchasing a brand spanking new model costs about roughly four hundred thousand USD but upon sale within your closet shelf another seven point eight percent profit margin applied making said amount cost somewhere near around sixteen ninety thousands $. This leads us closer towards determining our unknown variable value under these circumstances while keeping all mentioned conditions intact such equation gets simpler considering current calculations plus having accountable figures against them both numerically & verbally providing clearer insight thereby helping solve mystery equations faster thus better accuracy overall yield optimal results!",

You get my point; all these contribute heavily into determining which specific numerical aspect needs analysis when addressing 'how expensive'. Moreover! Not every single monetary item necessarily represents full value owning purchase because taxes/fees might apply depending upon jurisdiction hence impact overall expense without being directly tied to initial cost figure itself too..
