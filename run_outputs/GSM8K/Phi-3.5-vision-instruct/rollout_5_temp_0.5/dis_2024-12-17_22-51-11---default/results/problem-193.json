        " flamingos and none painted white because we only remove those when painting happens overnight or during their removal as stated it happened late evening so initially all would still count towards afternoon numbers. Therefore, comparison isn\u2019t valid anymore since everything was returned either way resulting zero difference compared to previous counts. But if any assumption can made like maybe due mistake someone may repaint existing ones instead returning hence leaving us with original quantity not affected i.e., remaining same initial amount including recoloring. Hence here ambiguity exists without knowing exact event sequence but best guess might incline towards equality under untouched status despite color variation within time frame provided leading potential incorrect calculation making statement uncertain based solely off context alone absent detailed happenings specific times etc..
