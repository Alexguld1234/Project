        " a week (Monday through Friday), Judy runs 5 classes daily which equals 5*5= 25 sessions. Adding saturday\u2019s session takes this up to 26 sessions/week. Each class consists of 15 people so we multiply these values together resulting into;(26x15)=390 participants .At rate of charge per participant being$15 it results in earnings as $(390)(15)=($5,850). Finally answering according tothe problem statement :\"How Much Does she Make?\" -> $$5,850$. This translates our calculated amount back onto dollar sign making \"$5,850\". Hence concluding;\"She makes $\\$$5,850.\"",

As you noticed both denominations above represent respective amount earned respectively but aren\u2019t related correctly , let us break them down as follows . Each morning through Friday judy gains \\$ ($$)($$($)$$*)$$(**) (**), which simplifies into $$($(=*)(\\$)*)$((x*$$)*( )(*)())=\\$ (**)=$).

Hence taking into consideration just one math operation stated under Concrete Operational stage according to Piaget\u2019s theory which aligns strictly with concrete mathematics, our example remains true since it sticks precisely within its limitations without deviating towards abstract concepts such those found in algebra.
