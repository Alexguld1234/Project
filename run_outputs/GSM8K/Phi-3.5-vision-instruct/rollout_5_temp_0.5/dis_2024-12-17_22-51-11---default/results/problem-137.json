        " question about chip purchase (a) Cost per packet without tax & discount; Here B(y), Y<sub>n</sub>= n+Pk means 'the value of y increased or decreased by P cents'. Since this formula applies only when increasing amount, I am using it here :B(x)=$1+(($1-$1)*(.1))=$.9$; This shows if one packaged item which usually sells for $1 was marked down 10%, new price would decrease by $.90=. Therefore ,Cost of Chip packets reduced .9*=$1-(0.9*$1)+Y_t=(Amount before Tax)-((Percentage Change)(Original Price)),which works like [(X/100)]*(New Price).Thus:(Number Packets sold *Price Per unit)/[100]=Total reduction Amount ;i.e.,[(bigger denominator /smallerdenominator )]*(% increase);Using numbers,$N*\\dfrac{(originalprice)}{initial quantity}=\\dfrac{percentincrease}{costperunit}$; i.e.$ \\boxed{\\text{Packages Sale}}= N\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{Price}}{InitialQuantity}\\right)\\div\\text{%Increment} =\\underbrace{\\dfrac{\\operatorname{amountreduced}}{\\mathrm{newpackagingcost}}}_A=\\underbrace{\\dfrac{\\partial q}{\\partial p}}_M$$Q_{red}=MP $$ Q_{red}=\\underbrace{\\biggl(\\tfrac {\\Delta TC}{\\Delta Quantity}\\biggr)}_{\\color{magenta}{\\dfrac{-TC}{p}+K}}_{\\dfrac {-tc }{q}- K}$$ {total Reduction}_{Package}=\\Box$$ Total \\;reduction\\;={-\\Bigg[\\dfrac{(tp){w_c} }{{v}}\\times k+\\sum^{h}_{j=l}(tk)_f\\Bigg]}_\\sum^L ({tp},{wp})_\\underline{.p}.\\tag*{$\\Diamond$} \\\\ Certain conditions need verification:\\\\ $$\\begin{cases}Tax\\,Applied={\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to 0}}   ~     \\,{{\\displaystyle\\frac{|dx|}{dt}}}    &\\implies dt~~\\rm{needs~~verification}\\\\ v ~~&\\textrm{'volume'}&\\\\ f~~\\rm{'fixed point function','rate'},~~~~~~~~{}~~~~||----&&&= dx",

Adding together Price Of Items And Service Charge We can see we spent exactly what our original budget allowed because every single charge factor into determining overall amount!

        ". Bags of chips cost $1.50 each and Rory gets 2, which equals 1.50 * 2 = 3. Cookies cost $1 each but only one cookie was ordered, thus it doesn't affect our calculation yet. Initially (before fees), everything together totals up as follows: Subs ($15) + Chips ($3) = Total food items before dessert included ($18). However, we still need to include the cookies into this sum resulting in Final price including all non-dessert item(sub+chips+cookies):  18+(1)=$19. Delivery Fee applies based off initial calculated value($19) not excluding cookies since its also part of original goods purchased along side other products.(Dessert count may or maynot factor depending upon if business owner decided whether their own policy treats them differently i.e separate purchase categories & associated charges etc.) Next time make sure clarify any additional points you might feel like mentioning..

        " so the chips cost 1.50 * 2 = 3 dollars. Each cookie costs $1.00 and she gets 2 cookies, making them 1.00 * 2 = 2 dollars. Therefore before fees or tips this adds up to 15+3+2=20 dollars spent just on food items (subs+chips+cookies). This means that their base price was already set to include tax if applicable but not including additional services like shipping/delivery charges and we also need to take into account possible sales discount such as buy one get one half off because these specific details weren't indicated when describing pricing structure which can really change things alot! However assuming it remains constant; plus considering no further changes happened throughout transaction process here\u2026it seems reasonable therefore according my calculations original overall charge would come down around about somewhere near close onto either side range say within approximately roughly slightly above maybe even almost exactly nearly directly equaling right across straight center point towards lower region somewhat closer together touchingly approaching yet still maintaining decent distance relatively far away beyond mere minuscule fraction hence resulting potentially significantly different result based mostly upon actual scenario conditions actually encountered during real time purchasing experience specifically relating back solely toward exact particular quantities involved especially particularly those having direct effect pertaining exclusively regarding relevant financial implications concerning single item purchase transactions only involving basic components sans any related secondary factors whatsoever due primarily attributable essentially entirely inherently largely completely unavoidable innately existing naturally built firm foundations forming fundamental groundwork essential pillars critical core elements serving primary purpose providing vital underpinning basis crucial support framework establishing sturdy solid dependability thereby enabling stable reliable functionality effectively functioning reliably efficiently successfully working well altogether harmoniously cohesive team effort synergistic cooperative work spirit shared enthusiasm energy combined forces collective action benefitting everybody whole community inclusive everyone connected positively interactively mutually engaged partnership success achievement joint accomplishment fulfilling objectives accomplished tasks completed goals reached targets met expectations exceeded benchmark achieved standards surpassed criteria compliance satisfied requirements passed tests approved examinations successful outcome evaluated favorably reviewed praised rewarded recognized acknowledged granted merited entitled awarded privilege earned conferred honored decorated adorned distinguished acclaimed bestowed gift presented cherished appreciated thanked accepted owed gratitude expressed shown via verbal affirmation nonverbal gesture physical",
        " cookie costs $1.00 and she also gets 2 cookies, which means the cookies cost 1.00 * 2 = 2 dollars. So far, without fees or tips, it costs 15 (sub sandwich) + 3 (chips) + 2 (cookies) equals 15+3+2= 20 dollars. Next, let\u2019s calculate the 20% service charge; To get this amount we need to find .2 times our original price before tax(before adding any extras). This amounts to (.2)(20), thus yielding $.40(.2)*20=$8 as extra charges when calculating percentages you multiply your whole value not just part since percentage calculation relies upon proportions meaning if I sold something using per unit pricing my earnings would vary depending upon quantity but here only one thing being calculated namely its basevalue hence why i always apply multiplicationto entire equation.. When all these elements come together \u2013 what will Rory's purchase including delivery plus tip equal",
        " 1.00 * 2 = 2 dollars. Without any other fees or taxes but including tips this comes up as :  15+3+2+5=$25 ($15+$1)$ (subs,$chipbags$cookies$\\mathbf{tip}$).
