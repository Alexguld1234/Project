This can further converted into words as follows 'Jackie makes (($) less using professional aid'. But we need exact numerical value '$', so I cannot proceed until having actual figure rather than question mark ($).

        " question because all calculations complete this part! To figure out which option results in less net expense (income loss), let\u2019s calculate both scenarios individually. Firstly, consider earning only through hourly rate ($105) versus paying one time fee i.e., employment service charge (=$90). Thus comparing these costs directly reveals that opting for professional assistance via paying the $90 upfront feebased decision proves economically better when contrasted against potential wages earned amounting to around $105 minus initial sum paid as per previous calculation $(($90-$3*3)). Hence concluding based on above steps; Therefore Jacki stands ahead financially approximately near about $\\(105 \u2013 \\$90)\\approx\\(\\$15\\)if choices steer towards self administration over procuring services offered professionally under discussed contextual conditions described earlier into consideration during comparative evaluation process henceforth initiated subsequently leading said conclusion obtained accordingly ensuring comprehensive understanding related subject matter associated particular situation being deliberated presently engaged within proceedings undertaken concerning relevant issues involved herewith pertinent ones emerging owing circumstances engaging parties implicated thus making requisite determinations regarding them thereby arriving upon ultimate resolution satisfactorily meeting desirable objectives whilst concurrently achieving preferred outcome beneficially impacting target entities concerned positively influencing their respective operational status consequently improving holistic performance level ultimately enhancing organizational efficiency productivity output overall effectiveness working functionality etcetera similarly applicable universally across various domains diverse industries wide range companies spanning numerous sectors globally international enterprises multinational corporations state owned private public limited partnership joint ventures strategic alliances mergers acquisitions buyouts divestitures spin off IPOs flotation rights offering options convertibles warrants callables premiums credits coupons rebates contingencies provisions covenants collateral guarantees sureties liabilities claims obligations commitments contracts agreements pledges bonds syndications loans facilities lines credit enhancement tools equity swaps arbitrage derivatives hybrid instruments structured products unsecured debt securities liquid markets hard assets commodities inflation protected index funds safe haven precious metals currencies sovereign wealth funds global portfolio allocations asset class sector indices benchmark indexes mutual fund ETF exchange traded note CFD fut",

Subtracting this cost from what the accountant charges tells us we get:  $90 - $(-$105)=$195$. To solve it using simple mathematical operations as follows:$= \\$ 90+ \\dfrac{(\\frac{\\$ 105}{$\\%})$}{\\$ 1}=  $\\dfrac{$90\\times$$(1+\\frac{\\$ 105}{\\$\\text {total}})}{\\$ 1}$=$90+$$\\frac{($ 90+ \\text{ }\\$  1. $$=\\text{ }$)}\\%%$$=-  $$\\text{Cost} (\\%)$$-\\begin{array}{|ccc|}\\\\&&\\%\\\\& \\text{$\\$   1}+\\; \\$ 90 \\\\|\\uparrow & \\,&\\downarrow | &\\quad\\implies\\,\\; \\; & +\\;\\text{%}\\end{array}$$$-and finally, subtracting these values yields $-105\\,\\%= -\\left\\{\\frac{105 \\cdot 100}{90}-1\\right\\},$resulting into our final value being:-15%.

Anything above zero results into fractions so converting negatives like (-15%) to decimal isn't always advisable since it won't reflect precise answers instead leaving them approximate.-or--A better approach considering all costs without approximations involved could follow along something similar yet different than presented previously such thus:`Negative fraction form example:% Neglect approximation error caused upon conversion through direct calculation methods `Hence solving here,$ % =\\frac{-((Fraction)/(\\text{\\$,cost}))\\pm [+(Percentage difference)]^2}{(Number Differences)} =~~\\Rightarrow~-\\qquad(\\frac{(Difference)}{Total}) ^ {\\quad}(\\div Cost)- [\\pm Fractional Rounded Results]+ PercentError.$ Here substituting numbers accordingly yielding first part result---`percent=(f/(c))^(d-(n)+per),(where n",

As such any benefits gained through this strategy could justly go into offsetting these losses; however we can ignore it because our question asks about comparing only considering costing factors rather than economic tradeoffs like time invested vs net gain \u2013 here both scenarios result exactly equal monetary values as neither provides nor takes anything away directly but yields identical amounts post calculation without additional considerations being addressed within said equation itself i.. However since hiring means paying $, so let 'x' represent potential amount saved whilst working instead using software etc.; thus simply subtract off initial charge against those savings hence ultimately equalling up front investment necessary under scenario b when compared wrt original plan described earlier mentioned above yielding same outcome despite seemingly contrastive nature present initially due simplicity arising direct comparison necessitated contextually situational constraint imposed upon assessment procedure implied underlying assumptions presupposing homogeneity regarding transactional value neutralities inherent throughout entire examination domain concerned",
