Meanwhile, since initially only fifty percent was pure water (we need not consider if any liquid gets poured out during transportation), so the amount of actual water obtained finally would come from summing up the volumes derived above plus thirty centimeters cubic worth coming directly into solution via addition. Hence, ((((10*3)/5)+ ((30+18))=approx 27).

Similarly, among your 15 liters of pineapple juice, since only about 3 fifths or around 0.6*15= 9 are actually liquid content; we can conclude that 15-9=6L consists mostly sugar syrup but still contributes something towards our desired solution mix amounting roughly into half when mixed properly(which translates to .1^2+.(2)*(.5)=.6). Therefore ,adding these amounts together would result us having (.5*.6)+((6-.1^2)/20)= 11/(1+5/.4).
