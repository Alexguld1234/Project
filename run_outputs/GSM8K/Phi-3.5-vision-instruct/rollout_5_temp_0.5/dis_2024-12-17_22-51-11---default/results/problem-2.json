        " the increase in the property\u2019s worth due to these improvements which led to its appreciation up by 150% over initial purchase price ($80,000). That means it became (100%+$150%) or 250% as valuable compared to what he purchased initially; thus, new appreciated valuation would equate to ($80,000*2.5)=$200,000. Profit can now be calculated using difference equation 'new profits=profit(f)\u2010initial_cost.' To calculate this we subtract original amount invested($130,000 )from improved asset value($200,000 ). Hence net resultant gain/ profit : f=$200,000-$130,000or ,f=$70,000.. ",
        " a 150% increase due to improvements, we can calculate this as follows: ($80,000 original price) \u00d7 (1 + 1.5), which equals $(80,000 \u00d7 2.5) or $200,000. Subtract your initial expenditure to find out what you would earn if sold it right away before making any profits but also deducting maintenance & upkeep fees during its period under management; so subtract them again here since no such info exists \u2013\u2013\u2009($200k selling price minus$130ktotal spending equates)$= $20000-$13000=$7000 gain when cashed!
