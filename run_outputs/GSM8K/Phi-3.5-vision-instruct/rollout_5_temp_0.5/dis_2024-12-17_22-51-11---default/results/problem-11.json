This means the result we need minus other costs equaling zero or just adding them up directly since nothing else affects those prices. Multiply everything together so you get: Total Cost=(Price_donut)*(Quantity)_donut+(Price_miniCupcake)*(Quantity)_miniCupcake+(Cheese Cake Price)(Total Quantity Cheese Cake))/(Denomination Per Unit)$. Therefore :total_cost=(204)+(160)+(330)/Dozen$. Since every single 'Dozean\u2019 represents one unit:$CostPerUnit=68$, putting numbers into equation like this yields $([(204)+(160)+(330)] /[68])=\\$(794/\\68)$,which equals $\\frac{794}{68}=$\\approx$\\textbf{$11.67}$.
