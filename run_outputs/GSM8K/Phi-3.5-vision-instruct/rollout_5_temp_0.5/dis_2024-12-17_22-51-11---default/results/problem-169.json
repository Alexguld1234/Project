During Saturday & Sunday, he only covers half distances walking 10 miles every single one hence adding another 2*10 = <<2*10=20>>20 miles .

And since he only rests or possibly goes slower once during this period (on Sunday), we can consider him also walking about one full regular pace of 20 miles but lesser distance due to fatigue/laziness assumingly making it half; so let us say approximately around 10 miles as mentioned earlier(he would not logically go back down without any specific reason). Hence over all seven days in a week, combining both types of activities, Pancho ends upto roughly having walked somewhere close to  120+10 =<<120+10=130>>130 miles through these calculations under assumed circumstances considering human nature traits like laziness post long work spans etc..
