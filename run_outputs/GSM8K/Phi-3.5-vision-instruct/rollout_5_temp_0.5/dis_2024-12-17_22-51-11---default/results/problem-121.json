We can represent the unknown quantity using any symbol such as X ; D representing doubling function i suppose . As well , kaeh bringing halves olives compared to morisettes means four divided by seven : s(X). Thus far our calculation shows us that kila has 8x=total_for_kaeh plus since its said both cant get less than zero when doing mathematical operation hence no negative result thus restriction was necessary. This tells me these statements indicate addition without negatives involved making them summation/addition cases whereas division would tend towards fractions therefore reducing accuracy required here just multiplication only..
