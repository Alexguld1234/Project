        " remaining days will be 365 - 180 = 185 days. During this period, the puppy consumes 2 cups per day which totals up as follows: 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups. Adding both periods together (first 180 days consumption plus second part), it comes down to being: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups needed for entire first year. Since one bag holds 110 cups, therefore she\u2019ll require approximately 5 whole or fractional(partial) ones based upon remainder calculation. Therefore, dividing full required quantity i.e., '550', divided by capacity of single bag ie.'110'. We get roughly four units but due consideration to all decimal fractions; hence rounding off brings us precisely around three extra portions necessary thus requiring purchases equivalent to six distinct packaged entities altogether within initial span during inaugural annual term post acquisition phase considering stipulated dietary requisites.

To find the overall amount needed, add both quantities together; therefore, it totals up to 180 cups (initial period) + 370 cups (remaining periods)= 550 cups required within the first year only. Finally, if one packet consists of 110 servings, divide the calculated quantity by packets size (per serving). Thus, you get approximately 5 petanets /110 portions= roughly 5 full bags rounded off since partial usage isn\u2019t feasible here making 'approximately' suitable as a qualifier but technically correct rounding towards zero still results into ~4 packs used initially based strictly upon math logic however reality factors like leftovers come intact affect such computations.)
