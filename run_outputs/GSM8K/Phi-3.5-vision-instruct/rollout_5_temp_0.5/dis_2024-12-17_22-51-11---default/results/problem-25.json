        " Next calculate apple expense: $1.50/apple * 4 apples = $6 for apples. Add these amounts together: $12 (chicken) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33 spent so far excluding pizzas. To find out how much was spent on pizzas subtract this amount from total payment ($50): $50 - $33 equals $17 allotted for pizzas. Each box of pizza costs $8.50 divide leftover funds allocated for pizzas($17), which results into approximately 2 boxes since division yields .17 as fraction part not whole numbers; but considering prices can only apply onto full items it means having exactly two packages purchased(no partial package).

Since the total bill came to 50$, subtract this figure from what it totals ($50). This leaves us with the remaining sum needed which you\u2019ll use to divide up the quantity of Pizza consumed; hence, our calculation becomes as follows: $$x$$pizzas sold* price($8.50)/item=$8.50x=(total bills)-(sum already accounted for)= (Total Bills)$(Sum Already Accounted for)=$($50-$33)(number/boxes required)$. Therefore; $(50-(12+$15+$6))/$8.50=((50$-33$)))/(PriceofOnePizzaBox), which simplifies into; (5$) / (8.5$), therefore getting ~$6/box.$ To conclude ; since she only purchased whole items, round down your result , because having half or even slightly over part of something doesn't work here .

Lastly multiplying this value by \"$8.50\" yields approximately \"(17/8.5)*8=17.\" Thus, based on our calculations it appears as though Martin could afford about three additional boxes of pizza; however due to rounding halfway through calculation such answers may not reflect reality perfectly... Instead perhaps its best simply said \"three plus or minus something\". To truly determine exact count consider dividing leftover funds directly by pizza prices without prior subtraction -- i.e., divide(remaining_budget)/box_price=(17/8.5). Doing so results into roughly 2 full quantities possible under original constraints leaving part remainder likely requiring partial discount off next item \u2013 potentially another slice assuming even bargain pricing allowed\u2026 Or considering simple integer division equates straight forward solution ~2 whole sets fulfill bill exactly WITHOUT fraction bits involved yet still keeping true intent intact via modulo operation check post computation!
