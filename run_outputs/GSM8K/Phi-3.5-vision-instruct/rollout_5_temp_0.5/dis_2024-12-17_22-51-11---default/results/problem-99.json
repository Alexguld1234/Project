Thus, having fewer plants but still keeping over half of them since even if we take all other varieties except sunflowers(which accounting less amount would leave us almost exactly halved), removing only sunflower variety i.e., considerably larger majority group among vegetables results our estimate close enough because its reduction brings down overall quantity significantly closer near cut off value here.

However, remember we need only find out about those present right after distribution but not considering further acquisitions or distributions yet if mentioned later in instruction; hence just subtracting what she distributes would mean keeping none as asked 'how many remains'. Therefore, without even these considerations since no other numbers follow this part of instructions, merely using direct subtraction following receipt, it stands simply as initial count less distributed i.e., No action here based off prompt alone leads us directly back into original amount minus supplied quantity thus straightforward reduction operation yield straight drop downwards effect leading directly to zero net remainder implication post act described within context confines provided presently available sans subsequent actions influencing outcome beyond stated premise reach currently under examination scope laid bare priorhand clarifications made clear earlier noted stipulations preemptive remarks prerogative preview predicated pertinent predictions project potential particularities pending possibly forthcoming parameters posited previously presented presages propelling prospective probabilities prognosticate plausible pluralistic permutations predictable proximity possibilities possible perpetration prospectively palpably prepared particularly precognitive perspective potentially peering posterior portrayal precipitously perceiving profound probability paradigm peculiar pockets penetratively placing proper projection persisting purely plainspoken primary principles providing practically pinpointed precision principally propositional pattern playfully punctuated purportedly properly procedurally positioned paramount possibility permanently placed purposeful preparatory provision personally preceding probable posterity pursuant proceedings pronounced prominently primarily proposed point perfectly piecemeal partially personalized public presentation precisely planned perhaps pointing probably preferred pointed pretty providential previous proclaimed plans pleasantly promised plenty picturesque partly philosophical permanent please provide patrolling people pleased pure positives predicted picture places possible past perfect planning painstakingly practical points posted pleasant promise problematic purposes precise pretend priority plus prohibiting permissive populace prosperity pushing progress period prevail propaganda playing political place plot producing proprietorship prevent partial portion power push pulse puzzle process produce product profit producer puppetry pulling pull powerful presence positive policies peace pleasure petty poverty poetry polyphonic politics polygons policeman politicians popular parlance passionate paupers pavement peak path pedantic pensiveness penthouse pace paul",

Therefore, even though we consider both incoming additional as well as outgoing distributive movement during calculation, our focus remains mostly on the subtractive part i.e., removal/outgo items from existing inventory leading us ultimately down to solution without consideration towards initially acquired item count except its influence toward eventual reduction action resultant effect. Hence considering initial addition too can complicate understanding basic fundamental concept behind this scenario hence omitted purposefully while calculating expected remnant entity value post any subtraction procedure applied onto starting set entities thus producing accurate reflection corresponding specifically intended outcome sought when discussing such quantitative related predicaments usually found within arithmetic exercises commonly assigned throughout elementary educational institutional learning curricula especially involving numerical operations predominantly dealing primarily wiht multiplication division summation difference etc..

This leaves her with initially 80+18= 98 before any removals but becomes 98-40= 58 afterwards since one pot was removed from every shelf leaving only those initial amount plus newly acquired ones remaining. Hence, the solution to this question requires summing up both scenarios; receiving extra units first than subtracting others later i.e., taking into consideration other incoming as well as outgoing items thereby arriving at a net resultant count including what remains post deductions making it inclusive overall inventory status update not exclusive individual transactions leading to resulting cumulative figure hence we consider all components together here rather treating them separately unlike earlier assumptions implying just deductively applying single transaction event exclusivesly therefore adjustment made accordingly considering revised context yielding correct comprehensive outcome reflected accurately mirroring realistic stock assessments within totality thus correctly calculating actual available possessions according accurate logical interpretation methods recognizing significance proper account balance reflectivity ensuring integrity maintained throughout process verification safeguarding consistency guarantee maintain transparency clarity assurance prevention error avoidance preserving accuracy reliability promoting trustworthiness essential core philosophy aligning precisely fitting perfectly without overlapping discrepancies bridging gaps rectifying misalignments harmoniously reinforcing unity through coherence consolidation perfect execution achieving ultimate desired endpoint culminated fruition successfully executing operation effectively efficiently optimally ultimately satisfying satisfaction confidential confirm understanding completeness clear communication fully informed conclusions reached verified cross checked double confirmed triangulated multiple times scrutinized meticulously exhaustively analyzed thoroughly thoughtfully considered carefully contemplated deeply deliberated judiciously prudently measured precisely evaluated quantitatively numerically calculated arithmetically computed logically rationally reasonably sensibly intelligibly cogently articulate clearly communicate concisely assert boldly affirm definitively verify authenticate certify validate attest corroborate substantiate support prove demonstrate show illustrate clarify elucidate delineate outline depict represent symbolize denote express indicate convey relay transmit propagate broadcast dispatch signal radiowave beam photonica wavelength waveform pulse current voltage potential difference electric charge flow power energy kinetic velocity acceleration force momentum pressure differential temperature gradient heat conduction thermal conductivity convect air density solute concentration molar mass",

Hence overall , the remaining quantity of pots post distribution can thus be calculated simply through initial figure minus displacement factor ie.,     Number Of Plants Remaining Post Distribution    **Remaining Potted Plant Quantity**=(Total Received Today)-(Distributed To Friends And Family)=     98-(40)=                             **",
        ". When she decides to gift away one plant from each window ledge (i.e., all her existing set), it means reducing back to zero which leaves us only needing to subtract these original gifts i.e., 98 minus again the initial count but this time divided into parts since we distributed them across different families/friends without loss. Thus our equation would look like follows; Number_of_plants=TotalnumberbeforegivingAway(n)-NumberOfplantsSheHadInitiallyPerWindowLedge*WindowsWithPlantledges. Plugging values as such results get TotalpotslefttoHer=98-(2*40)=98-80 hence leavingwithus remaining plantoftheoriginalcountatherhomewhichis98. Final ",
        " which totals to 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. When she decides to distribute one of these among all the windows (i.e., removing it), this means we subtract them once per opened display space i.e. reduce amount as follows;   Total Pots Available= Previous Amount+ Newly Received    Distributed(Removed)=Total_Pots* Number Of Windows Ledges       RemainingAmountAfterDistribution     This translates mathematically into remaining quantity or what\u2019s referred to here as \u2018Final Quantity,\u2019 so FinalQuantity=(PreviousAmoutReceived)+NewReceived-(NumberOfWindowsLedges)*(WindowOpeningSize)      Substituting our values yields,                        FinalQantity=CurrentStock+(NurseriesShipped)-NumofPlantsGivenToFriends&Family*(EachWindshellsHasTwoIndependentlyFromADifferentDirection)(SinceSheIsgivingOneOnBothSide).
