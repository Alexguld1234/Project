        " we know this amounts to 12 spooness, let\u2019s formulate equation as follows: x + 2 = 12 . Solving for 'x', subtract '2' from both sides gets us : x = 10 , indicating that initially, Julie purchased ten disposable utensils herself before receiving extras through gift from her better half! Henceforth, our solution dictates that Julia acquired precisely \u201cTen\u201d flatware containers during her supermarket stopover prior running afoul with insufficient cutlery count en route towards hosting said banquet gathering.

        " husband adds another 5 spoons. Together this makes x + 5 spoons. They both use up 3 spoons while sampling soup, leaving us with x + 5 - 3, which equals x + 2 spoons available before setting the table. We know that finally she sets down 12 spoons; hence we can equate our expression derived above (x+2) to 12 since those match what actually happened during setup time. Doing simple algebra leads us to conclude that if you move one side around using basic algebraic rules like addition or subtraction/removing parentheses etc., as needed, x would equal 12 minus 2, resulting in exactly 10 spoon(s) being in Julia's original packaging.

        " x+5 spoons before using any herself. Julie uses 3 spoon samples while cooking which means she didn\u2019t use all available spoons right away but still ended up having enough as later we know; she ends with exactly half needed plus one extra \u2014 i.e., if y denotes amount required based on guests attending and ending inventory equals twice this minus initial usage during meal prep time(i.e., double what would eventually need) minus those already taken thus leaving behind just over enough \u2013 hence , such relation holds .

        " stew, we subtract those which leaves us with (x+5)-3=x+2. Since setting the tables resulted in having altogether 12 utensils including these remaining spoons, this means that all other types of items equal twelve minus our spoon count equals just four flatware handles as follows; 12-(x+2)=4 , therefore solving this equation yields x+(12-4) or 8+(-2), simplifying further reveals that Julia purchased eight individual packages containing one spoon apiece. The answer is: 8.",
