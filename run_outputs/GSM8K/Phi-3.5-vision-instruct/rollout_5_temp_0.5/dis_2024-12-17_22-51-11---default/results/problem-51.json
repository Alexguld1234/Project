        " ended up at 1 (reverse direction), again we need to calculate when he reaches point 3 because reaching point 3 plus going one mile less means arriving at our destination i.e. Point 1 which was reached initially using speed 10 mi/hr . That implies Tom would reach third position same amount as initial journey duration ie ,  3 hrs. Therefore calculating required information : Time taken travelling reverse route(from 4th Position To Third) Travel Speed Required Cover Distance As above mentioned already calculated =>Time Duration=Cover Distance/Travel SpeedRequired cover distance needed=> From Initial Journey Using Given data   4POINT TO CURRENT POSITION ====&nbsp;&nbsp;  SPEED &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TIME      POITNATIOON AND REQUIRED COVERAGE FROM THIS POINT<===============================      4     |------------|----->        1            Total Distant covered          4          X                        Timetravelbacktoinitialjunction(PTWIP)=totaldistancedone\u00f7travellspeedreturn              \t             30miles            \u00f7    6mi/h               5HRS "
