To find out how many bags needed to make a total profit of $400, we divide the total desired profit by the net income generated per bag: \\( \\frac{Total Profit}{Profit Per Bag} = \\frac{400}{28} \\approx 14.286 \\). Since one cannot sell part of a bag, let\u2019s round down because partial profits would imply not having covered initial investments fully if transactions involve whole items only \u2013 hence making complete sales worthwhile before reaching fractional parts again; therefore, you need four fewer than twenty units due... meaning forty instead thirty plus ten ... thus nineteen full unit exchanges equate approximately seventeen hundred eighty seven percent (.17x\\( { }^{\\textbf{\\text{()}}}) \\)of gross revenue received",

To find out how many bags this would sum up to if the entire amount represents profits, we divide the total earnings which equals profit minus purchase price, i.e., $400/$32=approximately 12.5 bags. However, since one can't own half of a batch , rounding down gets us whole numbers . Hence, rounded off value becomes approximately '**12 packs**'. But let's check what happens when you consider purchasing prices too while calculating the exact countable quantity : Let\u2019s denote the original expense as E;   Purchased_bags*Purchase_cost+Transportation_Cost*Bought_bags=$E => Packets*$20+$Packets*$2($32-$2)=$Total ;=> Total/Price difference per Bag(or Profit)/Net Gain Per Baggage ==> Number Of Units Sold Here comes calculation part !!!

Therefore, considering you cannot actually sell partial goods; hence assuming only whole units exist when dealing with quantities like these (a practical aspect), rounding needs to ensure quantity remains unambiguously positive i.e., less than actual possible value.. Hence our result becomes:**(Nearly but not exactly!) **He sold approx around **14 bags !! Remember !!!
