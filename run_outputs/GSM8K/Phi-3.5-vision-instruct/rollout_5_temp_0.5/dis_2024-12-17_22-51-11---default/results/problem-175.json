To find out how many gallons Juan and Carlos produced considering their overall profit was only $25 let\u2019s divide their actual earnings over our resultant calculated profit per gallon . We can say thus; GALLON COUNT=(Total Earnings/Profit Per Gallon). Therefore,$(25/$15 )\u2248=~1.7. Although you cannot produce fractions of things, consider round up figures indicating here probably less than 2 whole galloons earned but not enough to break even due high production /cost factor i.e.$5xlessthanorequalto($25) leading us to approximate units close to ~2 full gallons. This tells me although fractional values exist while solving mathematically still real life scenarios may necessitate certain limitations henceforth requiring judicious approximations towards rounded off decimal places when dealing within physical constraints allowing mathematical flexibility beyond just strict analytical numbers often observed otherwise!
