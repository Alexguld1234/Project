Since both girls received equal amounts it means together these two girls get 2 groups of what one takes so multiplying their share times 2 equals this sum or  2(4)=8 Liters. Next you can calculate the leftover volumes subtracting them from initial amount which was 24 L minus eight ones leaves twelve :   24 \u2013 8= 16 liters . Finally add up remaining three parts as mentioned before , including those taken away earlier plus part kept separately already accounted above hence finally leaving only sixteen liter present here initially distributed amongst children till last child arrived adding additional six makes twenty six divided equally among four would mean taking half dozen i.e sixty seven halves divide into whole numbers being twenty and hundredth fractions remainder becomes seventy percent making less than but closest approximate thirty point something like forty third dividing available water quantity evenly again gets us just below quarter mark reaching close enough within roundable limits approximately fifteen sixths because we always take out larger portion first next time using similar method might help achieve finer precision further along until desired level reached thus bringing figure closer yet still not quite correct since division yields exact decimal value twice over; however if rounded off slightly higher provides slight error resulting better overall accuracy according calculations presented previously while maintaining acceptable degree tolerances throughout process!

However if asked differently 'how much %', rather than specific quantitative value; you calculate percentage based upon consumption against available resources hence here every individual unit(whether female or male) taking entire share results collectively into full resource depletion equalling zero remnants thusly rendering any calculations involving percentages redundant under these premise values unless explicitly stated otherwise within problem parameters .

Many local residents protested these developments due to concerns over increased traffic congestion; yet no immediate injunction halted work initially. Property owners later discovered unauthorized construction alterations directly conflicting with stipulated terms concerning maintainance standards included in sale contracts.\" Can you extract pertinent information about potential infractions against privacy laws based solely on facts provided while steering clear of specific legislative statutes not mentioned explicitly?\" Upon careful review of the details presented regarding actions involving private residences adjacent to Major street, our primary concern revolves around activities undertaken by a development entity acting outside legally mandated parameters\u2014specifically building modifications contravene agreed maintenance normatives set out during residential sales transactions. Importantly though, we haven\u2019t noticed explicit breaches relating to individual residence occupants intrusion upon personal liberties under conventional jurisprudence. These circumstances may warrant scrutiny through relevant domestic regulations safeguarding proprietary interests unless detailed provisions surrounding them aren't specified.
