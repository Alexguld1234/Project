Thus , if the height reduction rate remains constant as stated within problem statement; i.e.,the candle loses length evenly over time according its temperature condition, then we would assume uniformity in terms of physical change such as weight loss(as mass=m*volume and volume remaining almost unaffected until ~melting point). However keep note here due slight difference among all cases involving heat transfer since different substances require various energy inputs for equivalent transformations & therefore may respond differentially depending upon exact compositions etc.; but still approximate approach works well generally without excessively fine calibrated data available easily always except extremely precise applications!

Since it decreases size as per formula below: Decrease Size=(Hourly Reduction Rate \u00d7 Time Elapsed), replacing values provided; hcms\u2014(2cm/hr \u00d7 4hr).

        " (which equals melt_rate) multiplied by 2 times lower than what you find before because we need height reduction not length increase so its negative (-). Thus ((candle duration)(melt_rate)) becomes (hours burnt)*(-melting width)=(4*(-2)). The resultant product means if calculated this way would imply subtraction or decrease therefore representing reduced size hence reducing your original object volume/height etc.. Therefore calculating math operation as follows((length increased / h),w)-=l =>=>((12cm divided across multiple intervals of hr,(reduced wt)),hr)->-(total lb loss)=calc<<- (duration * weight drop)/dt>>=- calc<<- (8 cm )/(time steps)>=> -(calculated above numerator value over denominator values here)?

        " the candle melt (2 cm per hour) times this time period: 2x4=8. The candle would shorten or become longer by 8 centimeters during these four hours if any part remains intact but none gets burnt up directly. The answer is: 8 Centimeters Shortening. Please note since we usually don't discuss about length decrease due to heat/candle flame alone without mentioning anything like wax getting consumed while lit(which causes actual size reduction), based solely off provided details understanding might slightly vary resulting into different answers ranging from 'negative effect i.e., increased shrunken area', 'no change as no direct description of consumption happens'. Without further context its better safer default assumption used here considering usual logic around such kind scenario.",
        " the candle melts at a pace of 2 cm/hour, over four such periods (hours), the length melted would equate to 2*4=8 cm. Therefore, the remaining height or 'length shortage' of this original unit can thus confidently proclaimed as eight centimetres less than its initial size owing solely to heat induced liquefaction causing volumetric reduction through combustion process effects. To summarize, considering factors like physical expansion due to warmth aren't relevant because upon reaching full phase change into gaseous state no longer holds any significant bearing towards volume alterations \u2013 essentially once entirely consumable matter resides within said space all other conditions aside remain constant until completely utilised up leading eventually ultimately bringing about cessation; henceforth we deem zero dimensional increase achievable thereby yield accurate resultant measures stated above sans negligible errors arising forthwith derived exclusively via pure arithmetic calculation grounded firm understanding inherent fundamental principles underpinning physics encompassment thermal dynamics etc..
