Calculate this value while ignoring unit as we just want the numerical result without units right here: . Doing these calculations yields: This means Kimo spends attendance during math lectures approximately equal to all other courses combined due to them being longer..

Add both amounts together i.e., [6+6]=<|end_of_text|><|user_id|>=<<12>> hrs/wk but remember...we need them all multiplied out before finally adding these sums altogether!!!

With all this happening over 16 weeks, we can multiply 7*16 which results into 112 hours spent in class during the academic term. To summarize: Each Monday through Friday consists either of him being in one or other individual course(three lessons lasting about 1 hour each)or another consisting only of himself taking both courses together (two courses occupying themselves individually throughout most time span but sharing joint attention within duration twice every single cycle.)

        " Kimo has two 2-hour classes (Tuesdays and Thursdays). This comes out as  2*2*week_count; replacing week_count here it becomes 2*2*16=64hours spent learning during regular courses over entire academic year(semester) .
