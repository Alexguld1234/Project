Thus this question currently lacks sufficient data necessary for resolution. This indicates potential confusion around it within educational context; therefore refinement might aim towards establishing specific numerical relations among gender demographics, pupil allocation strategies alongside resources available including faculty ratio metrics etc., which remain unclarified presently despite apparent implications drawn earlier via 'group[s]'.

        " 60 girls, we know that there are 2*60 = 120 boys. Combining these together, there would be 120 (boys) + 60 (girls), which totals up to 180 children. Given that this needs to accommodate everyone within groups of 5 people per adult guide or 'student', dividing all combined into fives means you get  180 / 5 equals ten full teaching staff members needed who can oversee three classes filled out evenly among themself. This includes men & women both so therefore one could conclude their likely equal split resulting roughly around fifty percent female instructors underlining our main concern here ,the sex ratio not just student/staff ratios . ",
        " 120 boys. Together, there are 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students. Given the ratio of 5 students per teacher, we divide the total student count by this number, which results in 180 / 5 = 36. Therefore, there would need to be 36 teachers if these conditions hold true. However, since our question specifies only one set (girls+boys), so technically it might require less than half because all female members can get taught under one group or individual(which may vary depending upon actual scenario). But based purely on numbers provided 'there needs to be enough staff to handle children', implying presence of separate male & females groups due large size. Thus assuming minimum requirement, i.e., handling smaller portion/group means fewer Teachers required but taking overall larger demographics into account suggests equal split amongst both genders hence demanding equally divided teaching force leading us back towards first calculated value. Hence I suggest here answering according available data rather sticking strictly to interpretation could lead misconstructions! ",
        " since it\u2019s said \u201cFor Every Teacher\u201d, meaning one teacher per group(boy or girl) which makes our grouping X=X+Y. Hence Y=number of Boys minus Number Girls (which means all groups made up entirely of children). It follows that if you take away 60 girls out of these numbers, what remains will form such complete units called \u2018groups', i.e., G-(Girls)=B+(Boys)-G --> All Units Forming Completely Groups Comprised Entirely Of Children---> No Group Will Be Missing Any Child OR Need To Split Up Anything From its Members ==> We just need Only One Representative Member Or Speaker Per Unique Unit--> Because That Single Person Known As 'Teacher Is Not Shared By Multiple Students.-->So ONE Represetive TEACHER FOR THE FIRST GROUP OF BOYS AND SOME HORIZONTAL GRAPHIC REPREENSEATION CREATES AN ORIGIN IN THIS SPREADSHEET WITH LABEL CODE='GROUP_ID'.

Given that there are 5 students per teacher, we can find out how many teachers there are by dividing the total number of students by student/teacher ratio which would mean 180 / 5 = <<180/5=36>>36 teachers.

Therefore since Daniel scores second highest among all children except Robert who already holds top position due to being ahead David and John too both having lower ranks respectively behind him placing them in sixth place, seventh or even lowest rank doesn\u2019t affect others therefore remaining positions apart from fourth one(Robert), third ,second and first remain unaccountable while keeping other facts consistent within constraints hence confirmatively securing Benjamin in fifth spot thus making statement False if considering these new additional conditions yet without alteration against prior confirmed placements otherwise True",
