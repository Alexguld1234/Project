        " 2 bolts of blue fiber. To find out how much white fiber you need, we understand 'half that much'. Half of what (in this case) would be one bolt because halving doubles down on the original count which was already stated as being equal or smaller than four since only possible amounts here based on question context could also include fractions like .1 or something lesser so taking away another whole unit i guess might mean removing almost all but not completely thus leaving us about close enough just over zero point eight seven if u even considered fractional units...
