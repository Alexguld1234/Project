Therefore, Gunter's group made an average estimate of around 80 jelly beans per person if rounded down to match closest common whole numbers like traditional dice games or counting items physically present. Hence no need of 'nearest hundred'. But considering precision required might lean towards using decimal round off technique as well which could provide slight variance but keeps calculations accurate when dealing with large sums resulting in larger deviation margin such calculation needs better suited contextual usage otherwise stick with conventional methods unless asked explicitly about exact figures without approximations i.e., specific requirement demand precise computations disregarding simplicity factors involved typically found during manual estimation tasks usually carried out under time constraints assuming availability & accuracy preference balance scenario hence here choice falls closer reflective approximation methodology based purely individual preferences influenced largely likely due task complexity factor involving multiple varying values across set data points thus favor simple aggregation/mean approaches over intricate numerical operations normally associated complex analysis exercises despite potential mathematical techniques capable producing minor deviations owning substantial impact particularly pronounced relative greater quantity range differences typical observed numerous real life application examples showcasing similar instances prevalent diverse industries sectors including retail financial banking healthcare insurance manufacturing construction technology information communication entertainment automotive transport logistics defense security international trade commerce education research development innovation etc thereby rendering any advanced calculator tool essential less relevant within practical scenarios necessitating immediate decision making processes albeit limited scope applications primarily confined theoretical academia only serving educational purposes sole purpose facilitation concept understanding principles exploring various computation strategies applicable broad spectrum problem solving domains requiring versatile analytical skillset beyond basic arithmetic simplistic linear equations relational database systems statistical modeling predictive algorithms machine learning deep neural networks artificial intelligence cybersecurity cryptography quantum computing bioinformatics computational biophysics genetic engineering nanotechnology mechatronics robotics aeronautical engineering naval architecture maritime shipping merchant marine industrial process control management accountancy econometrics finance investments portfolio theory asset allocation capital markets valuation risk assessment credit rating default probability loan loss provision debt servicing fundamentals equity financing leveraged buyouts mergers acquisitions spin-offs specialty chemical fertilizers synthetics plastics composite materials electromobility renewable energies alternative fuels geothermal hydro power wind solar energy green chemistry environment sustainability climate change mitigation adaptation policies legislative framework regulations compliance",

However considering these three individuals collectively making separate individual calculations could lead towards forming groups whose estimates show slightly higher trends compared against any single person within them alone due partly perhaps because consensus forms around rounding/average behavior pattern amongst humans during estimations like this kind generally seen).
