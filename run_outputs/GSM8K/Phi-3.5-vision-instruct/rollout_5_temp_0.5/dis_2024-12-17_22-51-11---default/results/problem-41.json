Let\u2019s carefully reconsider what was asked in terms of \u201cthe digital root\u201d which refers specifically to finding out the sum iteratively until you get a single digit\u2014this would yield different results compared to just adding all individual integers directly (which equals to their collective sum rather than a \u2018digital root'). Indeed if looking solely based on direct addition without considering any 'iterative reduction', our earlier calculation stands; but remember, choices offered seem unrelated to correct interpretations thus indicating likely issues during formulation phase \u2013 perhaps misalignment concerning question premise itself especially regarding ambiguity around utilization/contextual meaning associated wordings such as \u2018gem stone\u2019 versus its expected role being merely incidental background context vs defining core functional attributes impacting output value range determination methodology used i..e whether purely arithmetic accumulative aggregation suffices herewithout necessary incorporation into overarchingly relevant scenario specificities).

Doing so yields: 9 \u00d7 8 equals 72 divided by 2 which totals 36. This amount represents halfway through our addition sequence because every subsequent row adds another zero once past middle values like 'Five'. Consequently, doubling results provide us what needs solving \u2013 exactly fifty-four!
