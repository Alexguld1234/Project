Multiplying twelve by three yields thirty eight (=thirty_eight); this equals Jan\u2019s stockpile because tenfold counting indicates tripling the quantity already accounted (+/- negative signifies opposite operation such as subtraction or division instead of addition)), so our mathematical statement appears like this: twenty seven (.fifty_) minus .five_(minus/subtract symbol)=twenty_.seven (_countable noun)(\u201chowever if we use \u2018less\u2019 here meaning _fewer_, i.d.)\u2014referencing another term indicating decreased amount \u2014results within eighteen=.
