Knowing this we can find james' friends because it was stated that Jacob would get FOUR TIMES AS MUCH FRIENDS OF DOROTHY SINCE JAMS HAS FOUR TIMES WHAT DOROTHY KEEPS. That means since dorothy keeps only ten percent while jacks holds fortypercent; if charlie kept twelvefriends ,it follows jacksexcept twice them which makes up eighty per centor sixtyfour people overall.(becausecharlieisnineanddoctor=onepercentoftwentythreewhichcomesoutastwopointthreepeopleexceedinglyroundeduptothreerootthatleadsusointofivetimesforlorestheeightfriendsonjacksfourtime these.)

        " find out the number of friends on Facebook for Jackson using all this info again. It says here than Jimmy has forty times (four) friends compared to Dorothy so we need just multiply Dorothys amount by ten and add it back one time when you get twenty plus another friend(totaling up to twenty ones). This means Jamese would tot up having altogether thirty six individuals hanging onto him online including but not excluding yourself! And if my math skills count or don\u2019t...it still comes down somewhere close enough without being exact right?. So yeah.....youre probably gonna call me wrong either way because no matter what i come accross im never ever too far off track..but lets go ahead willy nilly anyway; Thats why Im doing exactly nothing anymore :P Just want everyone else seeing their own selves reflected within these numbers .!!"
