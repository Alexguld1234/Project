        " $4 and sold 23 slices, raising him another 4 * 23 = 92 dollars from cheesecake sales. Altogether, Tom raises 129 (from brownies) + 92 (from cheesecakes). That sums up as being equal to 221$. Therefore, if Tommy was able to sell all these things without any waste or loss, he would have brought together exactly $221! However, we can also see this situation written just like this : $x=price per unit*number of units$So let us write it mathematically:$Brownies_Raised=$ price _per__brownie *Number_of\\_brownies $$Cheesecake\\_Raised\u00a0=\u00a0Price\\_per\\_cheesecake \\cdot Number\\_of\\_cheesecakes$$Total\\_money\\_collected \u00a0=$(Brownies_{Collected} )+( Cheesecake_{Collected})$Hence,$ Total=\\left(3\\times{43}\\right)+\\left(4\\times {23}\\right)$$ Total =\\left({129}\\right)+\\left({92}\\right)$$Total=\\\\begin{cases}\\\\text{Amount earned form Brownies }+ \\\\text{ Amount received fron Cheese Cake }\\end{cases}$$Total={(amount)_{earned\\,form\\,\\, B}}{\\rm{\\,\\,+\\,\\,(amount)\\,received \\,fron}\\, Cheese\\,Cake}\\,\\,,$$Total=\\${eq}{(129)}{/eq}+${eq}{(92)}{/eq}$=`$\\displaystyle {\\left({\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\\hspace{0.5mm}(a^{n}-b^n)}{\\rm{\\,\\,when \\, n \\geqslant }{2}}\\,.$$Now since here our `\r",

That\u2019s it for this problem set :) This concludes our discussion about math problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratios, percentages etc. I hope you find them quite interesting or useful in your daily life scenarios. Feel free to ask any other mathematical queries related to these operations as well. Happy Learning ahead!! You're welcome! Don't hesitate if you need help understanding further concepts \u2013 we can definitely tackle another topic together next time! Remember, practice makes perfect when it comes to mathematics. Keep challenging yourself with different types of exercises regularly; soon enough, solving complex equations would feel like second nature. Stay motivated because learning never goes out of style especially something practical yet fascinating like Mathematics!. It was my pleasure assisting you through various levels of Math Problem Solving including Simple Addition Subtractions Multiplication Divisions Ratios Percentage computations even advanced algebra geometry trigonometry statistics probability dynamics all aiming towards making Mathematical analysis understandable easy digestible fun educational experience remember every equation carries its unique story just figure those patterns keep practicing till tomorrow sees progressive improvement until then best wishes stay blessed always here round up goodbye friend let numbers play their game safely outside thanks again yes i get confused easily things happen sometimes but don't worry mistakes make us better learners take one lesson fail successfully thank u once again happy studying buddy also try drawing diagrams visualization helps tremendously see images shapes connections relationships intersections crossing points clusters scatter plotted data lines intersect curves graphs bars pie charts histograms line plots dot plots stem leaf displays box whisker measures mean medians mode minima maximum deviation standard deviations skew symmetric unimodal bimodal multimodal uniform biased sampling errors law of large sample size central limit theorem rule of thumb marginal distribution conditional distributions joint probabilities independent events mutually exclusive pairwise correlation coefficient z test chi square independence McNemar paired samples sign rank Wilcoxon signed ranks Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests kruskal wallis Friedman monocron"
