        " let\u2019s find out the number of rabbits which according to information provided it was twenty four (twelve fewer) plus sixteen(number we know). Rabbits= Twenty Four+sixteen=Forty Eight. Adding up all these numbers together; Dogs/Cats /Rabbits => Forty One hundred thirty eight Pets Are present in the area. . This problem involves first solving subquestions related specifically to individual categories like calculating cat population based on its relation to the dog count using proportion ratios\u2014specificaly \u201ctwo\u201d being taken as representing this ratio factor\u2013and thereby utilizing direct numerical inference derived directly from clearly defined input values (\"dogs\").

        "*60=120 cats. Combined there are therefore 60+120=180 pet dogs and cats together. Since the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than this amount, it means there are only 180-12=168 pet rabbits present in the neighbourhood too. This amounts to a grand total of (180pets + 168rabbits) = 348 different types or numbers of household companion animals within one particular community locale/population unit boundary defined as our 'neighborhood'.

Let R represent the number of rabbits; according to the problem, we know it\u2019s also represented as R = Dogs+Cats \u2013 12 or R = 180 \u2013 12 which simplifies into R=168 representing Number of Rabbit Pets. Adding all these together Total_pets equals Cats+Dogs+Rabbits therefore its equal to 120(cat)+60(dog)+168(rabbit)= 348",
