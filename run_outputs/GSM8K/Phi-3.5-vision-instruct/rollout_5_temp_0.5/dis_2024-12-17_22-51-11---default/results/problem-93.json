Therefore, Gerald's initial race timing came down as follows :  38 s+2 s=40 sNow , finding what percentage improvement occurs thanks to new food item !We know here % Improvement occurred in terms of decreased amount i.e. decrease comes off old value . That means its denominator becomes smaller due to positive change while numerator stays same therefore net fractional increase reduces thus making it comparatively big!So formula gets like this:-(Initial Rate / Final rate)*Total Time taken so far+(Original Timing)=CurrentTimeNew equation formulated according above calculation & condition => NewEquationForAgesAfterEatingWellness==OldVal*((100%-(ActualImpro/PercentGain))*(TotTimtakensofar)+OldAge)In our case OldRate ===> Initial ageofgheraldafterrunning===oldtimetakensofar====>>newageforgerallowndueetoimprovisedietinseconds=>\u21d2=(40)/(40)-(originaltime)(totaltimespenttherefutureyearsinsec)=>(38secondseacherafterthedeffectivemeasuretoupdatetheireatingplan)=><<solutioncombinethenewrateformulaabovewhichwillgeneratefinalresult::",

Hence I need better understanding before providing correct formula below but based off provided information lets assume here returnable goods include non-perishable items such as electronics , clothing etc therefore no additional deductions apply except standard applicable sales taxes already incorporated within purchase amounts henceforth applying simple % decrease method only without considering compounding effects among others noted earlier ; also assuming returned product fits all stated requirements including eligibility factors specific individual store locations acceptance criteria plus relevant exchange programs available offered specifically targeting certain types customers seeking alternative ways acquiring needed merchandise rather merely handoffs direct reimbursements solely guaranteed via conventional credit card transactions alone instead potential alternate payment modalities options mentioned above might still feasible contingency plans considered even though primary focus directed primarily towards basic currency exchanges involving principal sum immediately post checkout process completion phase throughout entire transactional lifecycle period albeit future adaptations tailored according evolving circumstances dictate subsequent monetary flow streams observed consequently ensure maximized capital preservation efficiencies achievable realistic expectancy levels achieved relative timeliness satisfying consumer demands fully accountability assurance delivered effectively facilitated accordingly maintained trustworthy professional reputation enhancing brand integrity enhancement strategy executed optimally pursuing sustained growth objectives consistently implemented over prolonged term horizon delivering holistically integrated strategic initiative supporting comprehensive business continuity resilience against sudden market disruptors potentially affecting financial stability safeguarding essential operational functions ensuring seamless smooth transition through transformative stages efficiently managing resources aptly aligning them suitably per identified crucial alignment goals defined thereby establish consistent robust foundation fortifying longterm success prospects further bolster competitive edge position strengthening core organizational values ultimately fostering solid positive public perception conducive driving overall profit share realized contributing significantly positively impacting bottomline performance indicator critically key aspect underpinned pivotal role",
        " we need to reduce this value by 1/11 (because improving performance means it requires less effort). Therefore , the updated times become : Time = OldTime / ((1+Improvement)/(Total Percentage))=Oldtime*((TotalPercentantage)=Oldtimes/(1+( Improvement))) . Putting values into above formula: New_Gerald_seconds=(40)*((100%))/(1+(10%=11%) )=.(40)/.89.=44.9 seconds approximately.. Hence taking only integers as answers provided earlier option C seems closest here.(However strictly speaking none of them exactly match!) However if one accepts decimals just like my calculated result as options you could also select B i.E.: ",
        " (40) by 10/100 or 0.10 to get the amount reduced due to better nutrition; so his adjustment amounts to just about 4 additional seconds less pertaining only to running times since other variables like rest period aren\u2019t impacted. Thus we need to subtract these saved 4 seconds resulting in Gerald taking approximately 36 seconds off as opposed to before when it took him twice as long plus those extra initial minutes accumulated because of poor nutritional habits prior. Therefore finally having finished somewhere around close but not exactly half compared against current performances made possible through healthier food choices\u2014which means if one wanted accurate figures down below almost within ten milliseconds accuracy might still result depending also upon weather conditions affecting both athletics themselves alongside respective training schedules besides numerous unforeseen circumstances regarding such competitions worldwide involving every single aspect contributing towards overall outcomes during actuality while participating directly via real participation itself happening simultaneously amongst others too..
