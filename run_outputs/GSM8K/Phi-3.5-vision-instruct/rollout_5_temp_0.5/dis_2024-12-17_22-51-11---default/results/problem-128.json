Next, since an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, we subtract 5 from the cost of a watermelon to determine the cost of an orange: \\(\\$45 - \\$5 = \\$40\\). Now we need to find the total cost for all items combined. To do this, we first figure out the quantity needed \u2013 which includes buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Once you have these figures (quantity), remembering their respective prices (\\$45 per watermelon, \\$15 per pepper, and \\$40 per orange), use multiplication to combine them into sums representing part of our grand total.
