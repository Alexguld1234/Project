This amount can also be considered as percentage because we calculate % growth based on current value hence it becomes $(valueChange/currentValue)*100$. Therefore percent change=$(125/$5000)*100%=2.5%. It means Profit gained if one decided to buy only these kind of items instead other ones was found out to be ((new price)-old Price), so here its $\\frac{Profit}{quantity}=\\frac{(V_{final}- V_{initial})}{n}= \\frac{$5125-$5000}{1} $. From this equation above you get $(\\Delta S)/m$, being delta quantity difference due to sale multiplied by count n sold , m represents actual merchandise mass present initially therefore dividing both sides yields us average productivity measure known commonly denoted ybar.
