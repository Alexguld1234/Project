As only three out of those four listed things aren't classified under 'non-food', therefore John gets discount on one such non-food product which can either be Roach Traps or Light Bulbs, let us assume it was chosen would be least expensive i.e., Lights bulb here , so amount spent excluding them would become 15-(3*10%) = 12 dollar.

        " Since we don't know if any food item was purchased (and thus not subject to tax), let's consider them as only nonfood items because it seems like this might typically happen without specific mentioning; therefore, tax applies to all those purchases. Tax would add another 10%, making it .1*15 or 1.5 extra dollars so its overall price ends being 15+1.5= 16.5 dollars spent including sales taxes..) However, since no information about what counts as 'nonfood', I can also deduce just adding one product\u2019s worth of sales tax which equates roughly around ~$0.60 ($4/item times 10%). This doesn't fully factor into our original totals but simply adds onto it slightly. It brings us close enough perhaps depending upon whether \u2018Milk\u2019 & other possibly included ones qualify under \u201cFood\u201d \u2013 here considering standard shopping practices such context hint towards excluding probable edibles hence treating every purchase equally pertaining their respective categories when calculating levied charges using %TOTALPURCHASE*TAXRATE(foregiving exclusive conditions).

        " any food item was included among those listed as nonexecetables (eggs being classified otherwise), John doesn\u2019t owe anything extra because this purchase seems strictly about home goods/non edible stuff thus no need apply additional percentages beyond what you might see when adding new furnishings or decorations during remodeling project type work; which normally would only involve small accessory touches rather than full outfit replacements etc\u2026 . But assuming here just one person working per location could help keep numbers simple too! Assuming again above calculation holds true : Cost Of All Non Food Items Without Tax=CostBeforeTax-(OriginalPrice+(CentsInPercentOfBaseTotal)) This means calculating amount before applying percentage rate using previous values ; i..e Original Prices Summed Together=(Milk+EggBox+LightBulb)+(CupsLids)=Second Part Added Value From These Subcategories At Last Only One Person Works Hence No Need To Calculate Extra Percentage Rates Here We Have As Given Values Milk=$2 Cups&Liners,$3 Lightbulbs$ & Bulb Caps/$4 Roaches Trapping Device($).We Will Use Those Directly Within Our Final Total ",

Since both egg and Milk came before any other purchase when considering order ,they count toward only one unit/group item price meaning its cheaper than separating them out into individual units.(it works better financially!)
