        " + ($40.00 \u00d7 25%) + $3.00. To find out 25% of $40.00 (which means multiplying by 0.25), you get $40.00 times 0.25 equals $10. Adding these together gets us $40.00+$10+$3= $53. Lastly add their service fee; so your last calculation would come down to being equal as follows:$53.Adding the additional tip comes to: $53+$4=$57$. ",
        " initially cost $40. They add a 25% service charge which comes out to be .25(x). This results in a new subtotal (not including gratuity) being $$$= 40+(.25)(40)=$$$(where \\$ represents US Dollars.) Adding both charges together we get $$\\$=(4)+(.25)\\times(4)$$Finally adding the tip $\\$\\,\\,$ yields \\[\\boxed{(\\$.)\\,((.25)\\times(4)+\\,(4))\\,\\,+\\,(.25)\\times(4)} \\equiv (\\$.)\\, ((.25)(4\\, )+(4)).\\]\\]",
        " Since the delivery charge counts as a percentage, we can calculate it separately first. To find out how much the additional charges amount to (including both tips), divide them into their individual values; so you get ($4.00 / ($4.00+$3.00))*($40+3). It works because we want everything above our base which equals just adding those parts together/multiplying respectively since percentages deal only with incremental differences not absolute totals over time thus making dividing unnecessary unlike compounding interest calculations etc.. Simplifying further would result in ((3/(3+4))*$43) or approximately  16.07 . Adding all these numbers up gets us about $(40+(16\u00b7(1/2))=58 ,rounded off decimal points due diligence while handling monetary transactions! ",

Firstly it says here that \"$0.25\\text{ } (twentyfive percent) %\" gets thrown onto the initial amount owed which means .25*40=$10.00 needs to go towards covering said tax rate; second part states specifically a dollar charge goes toward making things easier via transport/delivery service ($1.00), last but definitely most important piece involves leaving behind cash thanks solely outward courtesy being paid thus forth referred to otherwise commonly known throughout history under such terms like 'tips'.
