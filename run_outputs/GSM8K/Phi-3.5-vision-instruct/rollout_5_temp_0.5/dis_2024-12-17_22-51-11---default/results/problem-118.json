This equals 30 - 10 = 20 extra vehicles arrived during those two days. Finally calculate the additional container count based on known quantities per box; if one container holds exactly 5 items i.e., a vehicle here, divide our new value obtained above by the established rate (number of units/container) which yields us division operation like thus : 20 / 5 , therefore, it implies that another ten boxes or containers loaded with the same average content as before ended up being cleared through Customs within those time period. Hence my conclusion would infer approximately zero plus possibly fractional parts close but less than full integer values greater equal or smaller compared to totals noted yet definitely not reaching double digits when considering integers only .
