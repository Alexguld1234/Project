Next, calculate how often these cycles happen every week. We know he repeats them 3 times a week. Thus, over four weeks or seasons, he completes three such sequences twice making it six sessions altogether. Consequently, throughout those four weeks, we can multiply our daily combined duration by the frequency during which this routine recurs within seven periods (seasons). This means, doing so yields us; 3 hrs/weekly sequence x  6 weeks = 18 cumulative workout durations amounting up to; 3 hr periodicity multiplied again by its recurrence rate equals, therefore yielding him a total dedication of eighty-four consecutive units totalling nineteen hundred twenty minutes i.e., thirty years worth of television!

Therefore across those same three nights, he devotes another 3*3= 9 hours talking instead of sleeping or hobbies other than TV/Reading. Sum up all these numbers getting him equal to 4(TV Night)- Nights)+3*(readings & tv mornings&even). This totals to fourteen eighty-four.

        " Over three such instances (weekly), it would take him 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 hours doing both activities together once a week. To find out how long he devotes these leisure activities during four weeks multiply their weekly duration with length in numbers needed; thus you get 12 * 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 hours altogether. The answer is: 48.",
        " over two sessions (one morning and evening), he spends 1 * 2 = 2 hours reading. Add these amounts together to find out how much time he devotes to leisurely activities during one weekend period. His combined activity time equals 4 hours watching plus 2 hours reading which comes to 4+2=6 hours/week. Multiply the amount of time devoted within a single weekend upward through four equal periods because we need it across multiple weeks; specifically three consecutive full weekends followed by partial fourth (just Friday). That means multiply six(hours) by both seven (days) and forty eight (weeks); thus sixty (hrs)*seven*fourteen yields thirty thrice twenty or exactly twelve hundred clockwork revolutions around our dear sun known commonly\u2014but don\u2019t get confused!
