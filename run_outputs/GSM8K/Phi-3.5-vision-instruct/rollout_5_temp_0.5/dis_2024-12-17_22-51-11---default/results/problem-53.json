On friday, the mechnical only worked on fourteen car tires without repairing anything else so this time the cost was calculated as (14*$40=)$560 making it clear than Friday generated almost twice as big amount. To determine which workday received greater income we need subtract values; ($560-$440). Doing these calculations gets us upwith value $(120), indicating the second working session ended being better due to increased costs paid. As result Mechanics made $120 extra profit during their most profitable business hour!
