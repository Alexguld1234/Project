This simplifies as square root of ((cubic_root)(4.9)^3 meters which equals about .sqrt(4). Hence squareroot or fourth power multiplied onto this value provides nearly exactly cuba_power result again due to round off error.\r\r[Mathematics] Note : As per usual calculation rules apply cubits cannot directly add up through sqrt(). \rHowever using approximation concept if calculated numerically its closer than expected even without applying approximations!
