Hence multiply this charge across those expected households i.e., Cost per Client \u00d7 Number of Clients Total Spending equals : $9 \u2022 8 = $72 Explaining about future profits Assume here that eventually half come into agreement; That means around four homes may use services from Kim. To achieve maximum revenue knowing average gainings being used as reference point let us calculate gross earnings assuming these cases. Here comes important concept \u2013 Weightage factor while estimating projective results helps better decision makers decide their goals keeping both possible positive & negative factors considered well within perspective thus providing scope towards balanced judgement hence enabling leaders optimize opportunity space accordingly leading growth based approach rather than purely data driven methodology focusing mainly just numbers alone without considering broader picture resulting effective strategies ensuring lasting sustainable progress over time .

Similarly calculate amount of Cloth Packs; being required once per Home, he also serves these same (eight) homes which require him eight ($5 package).

        " multiplied by 2 bottles per client equals 16 bottles of bleach required (8*2=16). Next, calculate the amount spent buying these bottles of bleach. Since it costs $2 per bottle, multiply this price times the quantity desired \u2013 which totals $32 ($2/bottle X 16 bottles =$32) This means Kim spends about $32 or roughly \"$3\" per existing & prospective client based solely off those listed necessities. Multiplying said sum against the respective count of current as well as aspiring customers yields approximately \"$24\"($3 \u00d7 8 Clients)=$24 Total investment within necessary resources thus far. Consequently subtract out such value form overall anticipated revenue; therefore one finds him likely earning nearly \"$92-$24=$68\" ($92 \u2212 $24$).

As mentioned above he also requires one package for every client which equals  8 customers x $5/package = $<<8*5=40>>40 spent entirely on these items. Adding together those amounts ($32+$40), we see that his overall costs equal $32+40=$<<32+40=72>>72; it means Luke spends $72 altogether as part of this particular scenario during any single time period (week). Finally find out your actual earnings excluding what you just calculated. We know beforehand(from problem statement)that Kimm actually makes around $92($92-$0=-$92); however since when using basic accountancy principles our initial profits calculation gets impacted upon further adjustments such like here having negative values etc..
