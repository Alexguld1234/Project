        " Since no other types of animals received any straw except the group of rabbits (which was mentioned later) or rats as part of our question focusing solely on the rodents, these 50 pieces mean only half of the overall 160 allocated can go towards the rats because it seems every animal apart from bunnies isn't getting this particular set allocation per individual. Therefore divide what remains which would equate to 160 - 50= <<160-50=110>>110 remaining stalks shared amongst three equally divided amounts into single quantities.

To determine the individual value without actually doing division directly related to 'three cages', it would help conceptualize the idea better through prime factorization or simply understanding simple multiplication problems involving multiples of six until you reach something around 110.

Hence approximately 'Four Rats'. But keeping precision important while dealing financial transactions(or here sharing items), assuming multiple types could result in uneven distribution; rounding off can cause discrepancies so exact division indicates probably seven as nearest lower whole no., whereas higher might show excessive quantity if any unaccounted remains exist over count. Therefore one may infer around six being closer accurate estimation considering shared nature without fractional quantities involved .
