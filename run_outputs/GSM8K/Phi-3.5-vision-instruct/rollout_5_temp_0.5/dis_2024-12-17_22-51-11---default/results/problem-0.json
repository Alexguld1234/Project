        " ones Janet uses herself \u2013 she eats three and makes muffins with another four; so this totals seven (3+4) usages out of 16, leaving 16 - 7= 9 extra eggs. To calculate what these contribute monthly earnings Janet generates via sales, we multiply those remaining excess quantities by cost price i.e., ($2)*(9)=$18/month earned just through sale of leftover products! However if you want weekly revenue instead please divide your figure accordingly since weeks can vary depending upon whether it included weekends or holidays etc.: henceforth let me present following computations both ways below:(i.) Weekly Earnings=(Revenue Generated Daily*Number Of Days)/Week Number=($2*9)/Days Per Week Assuming standardized distribution across all Weeks,(ii). Monthly Earnings=$18 As mentioned already above based only off single day calculations.(iii). Annually Based Upon Same Parameters as ii), Total Year Long Gains would equate up towards slightly less than ~(2*$2*Nights Factor)+~((Annual Nights Offset)-~$2*(Initial Day Sale)). This represents annual variation within calendar years due mostly owing mainly largely varying length seasonal periods plus extended public observances such New Years & Veteran Holiday Timeframes occurrences amongst numerous other diverse reasons.. Overall though ,as long ago calculation methodically applied yields consistent results over multiple trips . Henceforth my initial statement remains intact although additional complexity exists when taking into account potential fluctuation factors including differencing specific time frames vs aggregative averages used previously .. Nevertheless overall approach still holds accurate despite any irregular variations incorporated along said timeline intervals respectively ! Therefore conclude herewith saying ; Without further ado : Doughboy 'Duckers'-duper !! Phew ... Enjoy yer delicious omelettes full ya big booties baby!!!!!
