They also rode the luge three times (twice each), requiring another set calculation; this comes out as 3*6=18 additional tickets spent on the luge since every ride costs exactly 6 tickets which was their common price point hence simplified our calculations considerably. Add up all calculated numbers \u2013 starting off we noted earlier that pam & Fred expended precisely thirty-six(tickets) through rollercoaster experiences plus eighteen more via thrilling slides down snowy slopes or 'luging'.

Each was also going to ride the luge twice so, 2 people \u00d7 2 rides equals six additional rides bringing us up to 6 original ones plus another set makes ten trips down all the rollercoaster both together. As each trip required seven tickets; therefore we multiply our count which came out as ten times seventeen making one hundred and seventy . Therefore their combined ticket usage comes to  170 , thus 'their combined'. But since your question refers specifically about pam & fred individually i calculated only using info mentioned pertaining to P&F explicitly :    [('roller_coaster', ('total_rides': 6)),      ('luding', ('total_rides': 4))].
