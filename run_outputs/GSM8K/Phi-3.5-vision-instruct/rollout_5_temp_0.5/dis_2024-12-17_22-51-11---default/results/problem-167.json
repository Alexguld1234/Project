Their combined future ages (in 2 years) can thus represented mathematically using these variables plus additional amounts representing those respective time periods away; this results into equation such as : ((B+2)+(2B+2))=28 . Solving it provides us , which simplifies down to -->  3B + 4 = 28 ; Subtracting Four From Both sides shows -->   3B = 24 ; Dividing both sides by three reveals -->     => B= 8 Thus indicating currently --Brookes Age-- Is eight yearss Hence showing seth 's present age being double means ---->      =>        X=       >>      =<< =================>         ?:( ) ",

By simplifying it you get;  3B + 4=28 =>   3B = 24      Therefore ,Brookes current age(B)=8 . And so using our first relationship about seth\u2019s current age which was double brook\u2019s currently :     Age_Of_Seth = 2*brooks_current_age       = 2 * 8          =24 ;So ",

Solving this equation for B yields B=(28\u22124)/3 which simplifies to B=8. Therefore, we know that currently, when substituting back into our first definition regarding Seth\u2019s age it comes out as; Seth = 2*Brookes_age so ,Seth=2*(8).
