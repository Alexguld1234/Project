Difference in speeds here means 10mph(original pace)-5mph(new pace)=5 mph lesser since when going faster you spend shorter times covering same distances hence our initial calculation remains valid but second part needs adjustment based upon new paces involved therefore calculating like such : Speed=Rate*Time   Time taken would equal Distance covered divided by rate    Thus initially spent extra minutes turned into regular intervals as compared previous ones ,now slowing down alters interval length thereby affecting overall count .
