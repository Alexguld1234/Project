        " (3/4) = 60 votes. Since only one vote can go per student, this means all other non-winning ballots went towards the second place or invalid options if available. To determine the exact vote count for the runner-up without additional data indicating otherwise such as spoiled, blank or absent ballots being subtracted first would lead us toward assuming remaining voters cast their vote for them directly; hence it could roughly estimate around half depending upon typical voting behaviors under uncertainty while acknowledging lacking certainty due to no specific mention regarding distribution patterns among unsuccessful candidates besides not achieving majority share specifically attributed solely.

        " need to find out what fraction represents the remaining voters (those voting against). Since all fractions together make up the whole (which equals one or 'all'), if the winner gets 3 parts out of four equal groups, this means the other part belongs to the loser so it would get only half as many vote because three plus one makes four (whole), hence the losee won\u2019t receive just \u00bc but twice less than quarter i.e., \u00bd times our value for q, namely  60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 / 4 , resulting into being allocated   120\u00f74= <<120\u00f74=30>>30 votes .

To find out how many people represents this fraction we multiply it times our denominator which is eighty; so three hundredth multiplied against eighty yields sixty votes cast into favor of the other candidate since four divided into eighty results seventy overtwo or thirty point fifty seven fifths.
