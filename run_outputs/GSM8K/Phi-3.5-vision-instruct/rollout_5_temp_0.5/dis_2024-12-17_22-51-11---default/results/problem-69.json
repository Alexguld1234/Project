        " of $100 including both what she initially possessed plus her allowance. Subtracting out just the $40 allowance (the part outside initial possession), we find that Bailey began these transactions having held exactly $60 before beginning this spending or saving cycle. Therefore, Bailey\u2019s starting balance was $60. This means prior to receiving any form of additional income during those eight weeks time period \u2013 simply put, you subtract your expenditure ($i.e., the sum spent)from post receipt/acquisition cash sums; which leaves behind only original assets brought into play i.e.; pre existing equity position! We deduce thus that \u201cInitial Money\u201d=Final Cash Amount-(Weekly Allowance*No_of_Weeks).

However under this particular situation without considering unspecified parameters like cost spent during mentioned period hence we deduce initial monetary worth solely derived purely formulating equation provided only which would lead us conclude presumed starting capital being \"$60\".
