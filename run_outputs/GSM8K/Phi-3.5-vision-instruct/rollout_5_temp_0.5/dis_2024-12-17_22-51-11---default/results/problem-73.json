This means overall expense totals up like below \u2013 first payment includes just principal part being made together with only single late fee; second makes both parts but adds yet another nonrecurring sum onto already calculated total because next transaction cannot happen before previously completed previous instalments fully concluded without any delay whatsoever hence leading again towards cumulative rather than separate calculation approach here compared against standard rate based calculations involving fixed amounts across different periods irrespective whether transactions occur simultaneously throughout period or sequentially afterwards over course time frame respectively thus making sure nobody doubts our results since everything works consistently regardless whenever someone wants clarification regarding formulae used etc.. First payment comprises solely regular installment portion while introducing initially unknown quantity called variable 'x'. Hence Total Payments Made Per Month Calculations As follows:\\\\\\\\Total Cost Of Phone \\\\n(Original Price)\\n$150\\n+$3 Interest Rate $\\\\\\\\%(\\text{Rate})\\n$\\\\times OriginalPrice ($)\\\\\\\\+\\nPer Unit Amount Paid During All Three Purchases Overall=Monthly Summation{\\tX=\\sum_{k=1}^{M}\\\\frac{(Principal+Interest)}{P}$} =\\left[{\\displaystyle \\binom {K+N-1}{K}}\\right] $$\\Leftarrow$$p=$ Principal Amount PaidEach Period;\\tranferPaymentPeriod={principle_amount}/timeframe${R^T}$$={\\dfrac {($){r}(pay)} {$}}={\\dfrac {totalPaidForPhone}+({interestrAtYearlyInterval}))* ${timeUntilEndOfLoanTerm})$}\\nSo With These Values Plugged Back To Previously Derived Formula:\\n$(230)(0.2)=$ X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r",
        " of $750 * (2/100) = $15. Therefore, the grand total comes out to be $750 + $15 = $765. Since this needs to be paid over three months; hence, it can be equally divided among these periods as follows:$765 / 3 = $255. Hence, shelia need not worry about any unplanned increases or decreases because no matter what price adjustments occur during those next few weeks all together their value add up to nothing but exactly $765 which gets evenly dispersed across every dollar increment throughout the entire span mentioned here namely within time frame equivalent into just plain old mundane routine existence called 'one year'. And since we already know such distribution pattern beforehand why bother ourselves dealing further upon them when eventually things always works themselves out best! Just sticking onto main topic question.. As soon as understood above everything seems quite clear ,it simply points us directly towards only one particular conclusion :$ Per MONTH PAYMENT= $ [TOTAL BILL DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF DAYS IN YEAR] . Here case study presented states clearly otherwise ; if anybody still insists claim differently its totally wrong !!!! Because according law itself defines periodicity rate under different circumstances also including tax rates being levied annually etc alongwith other specific provisions relating respective financial instruments used respectively therefore making sure everybody understand importance underlying principle behind same thereby avoid confusion later while actually attempting comprehend meaningful concepts inside finance domain altogether !! ",
        " = $153. Therefore, over three months (which means dividing it into thirds), this totals up to ($153 * 5) / 3 = $255 per month. Thus, if we assume no other charges apply apart from these mentioned ones, Shiela needs to remit around \"$\\textbf{255}$\" each month for three consecutive months inclusive of all levies imposed.",
        " the monthly payment over three months, divide this sum by 3 resulting into approximately $765 / 3 = about $255 (rounded off). Therefore, the amount paid every month towards these devices is around $255 . ",
        " be approximately $765 / 3 = about $255. The answer is: $255 (approximately). Let me know if you need further clarification! I can explain this calculation using simple fractions or decimals too \u2014 whatever makes it clearer to understand. Is there something else within these examples or another topic overall that needs deeper examination or practice through solving similar problems together? You might wonder why we calculated one percentage first before calculating the whole amounts for multiple items because sometimes percentages apply only individually rather than being multiplied across different purchases directly like currency values often do\u2014it depends whether rules around specific discount codes/pricing strategies come into play which isn\u2019t always straightforward but let\u2019s delve deeply hereafter shall ye continue inquiring upon such matters as your heart desires most fervently"
