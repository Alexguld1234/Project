        " in 10+21+23=54 stickers. Charlie gave away 9 so was left with 54-9=45 stickers. Then using 28 makes it just 45-28=17 stickers remaining. Thus Charlie still holds onto about 17 (rounded down) stickers. The answer is: 17.",
        " = 54 stickers. He gave away 9 stickers so he was down to 54 - 9 = 45. But he also spent another 28 stickers using them for cards which leaves him with 45 - 28 = 17. Therefore, Charlie still has 17 stickers remaining. ",
        " 'how many did Charlie use?' First remove what he doesn't lose; so take away those which belong to others (he didn\u2019t buy nor get). We start again counting only original ones without extra stuff. That makes our new base equals to zero minus these numbers (not all but enough as per question), i.e., negative values not possible here! And lastly subtract remaining loss/gain events like : giving or using something downwards (-) instead plus (+).

        " store making it 31 (because we add them), and another 23 as gifts which makes 54 stickers altogether because again; when receiving or getting something you ADD this amount so adding these amounts together results into 54(total). When Charlie gave away 9 stickers to his sister, we subtract those numbers from our initial sum meaning removing things/items therefore ;if ever one takes anything out than WE SUBTRACT.. This leaves us with 45 (Because; 54-9= 45) And finally , if Charles uses up 28 stickers for decoration purposes means subtraction hence resulting into :  45 \u201328 . That totals to get what remains i.e., the resultant difference .. Which equates mathematically equals to GIVEN THE RESULTANT NUMBER OF STICKERS TO REMAIN IS QUITE BASIC WHEN ADDED OR PURCHASED ... CALCULATING IT AS MATHEMATICALLY \u2026 ENSURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS AND TRACK WHETHER INTERNATIONAL UNITS LIKE KGM VS ENGLISH SOLUTIONS .... To summarize... Mathematics needs precision however simple problems can become challenging due to different units / conversions etc but once understood its logic becomes very useful even further including other subjects like Physics & Chemistry amongst others ! Hopefully understanding helped here! ",
        " adding up as (21+23)=44. Giving away 9 means subtracting those which leaves him with 44 - 9=35. Decorating cards uses another portion so we take them out leaving us with  35 - 28 = 7 remaining. Thus, the answer is: 7.",
        " = 54 stickers. Out of this amount, Charlie gave away 9 to his sister leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45. Finally, when using another 28 stickers for the card, it leaves Charlie with further reducing downward 45 - 28= 17 remaining stickers. Therefore, Charlie ended up having only 17 stickers left. ",
        " subtract those that he either gave away or used which was 9 (given) + 28 (used), making it a subtraction problem like this: 54 - (9+28). Doing one operation inside parentheses first makes things simpler here ((9+28) becomes equals to 37.) We get; therefore the expression simplifies to 54 \u2013 37 equalities as follows  54 \u2013 37=\u2009\u2009\u200a17 hence he only remains with 17 stickers afterwards . ",

        " so he gained a total of 21 + 23 = 44 additional stickers. This puts him at a new total of 10 (original) + 44 (additional) equaling 54 stickers before any transactions happened. When you remove the ten stickers he gave away to his sister (54 original - 10 gift), it leaves us with 54 - 10 = 44 stickers remaining. But when we subtract those 28 stickers spent to decorate one heartfelt letter...
