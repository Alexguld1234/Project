It means if Suzy recently acquired hers last month during apple event launching iphoneXR ,ben needs latest Gen Apple devices probably either series IX too .

        " one year old, so it means Ben's phone is 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 years old. But considering all three iPhones combined their age would add up like this; (x+y)+(y+z)=age*(Suzy,Ben &Brandon). We know z=-suzy_phone because ben > suzy , y->ben_phone therefore ((x)\u2212suzy_iPhone)+(2Year \u2212 Suzy\u2019s iPhone)=years_(total iphone), putting numbers back into our equation we get((X)+(2))=(X\u22121)+(2)). Solving above gets X=one . That results in brandon being 4 years old when compared to benefin who was identified earlier to having only 2 years worth of age assigned already.. This makes sense since what was said about bens phome always seeming younger thus leading us closer towards assigning him lesser value but still greater overall.(YEARLY TARGET FOR BRANDON\u2014a bit overdue!) However even though most people see/hear me saying things along these lines my thoughts behind them aren 't exactly literal nor am I trying specifically pinpoint you guys...but rather understanding why everything seems harder without actually knowing anything else first before jumping out headlong onto specific details such logic flows better within context rather simply stating facts right away.\u2014no matter if im wrong sometimes--so don't take offence :) As per requested solution following logical thinking process applied here yields : BENNYSPHONE Age -> YrsOld => Math=> SUZYAge --> YearsTotal +=BENNSphOneValue+(WITHINSUZYAGE)*(-1); Result-->BRANDON PhoneyAge ==> Compute&Calculate:: One Year Old Phone Systematically Adjustment Of Expected Outcomes Will Help You See Where Your Thought Process Led To Final ",
