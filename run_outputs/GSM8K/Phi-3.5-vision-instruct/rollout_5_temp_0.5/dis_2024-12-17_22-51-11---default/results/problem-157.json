This results in [(full laps)*(length)+([shortened]*[halfways])], or [((2+4)/2)*100]+[(3/2)*40]=[[3]*100+[(3/2)*40]]=300+(60)=360 Yards for each individual pass until finishing third quarter mile repeat.

Thus, when Kelly moves forward until reaching west side boundary while moving Northward till midpoint implies distance traversed equals double width plus thrice single width distances, equalling  2*50+3*(100)=800 yard roundtrip cycles initially making up her effort apart from remaining same if not considering initial move backwards equivalent to no additional mileage counted here.(the countdown begins only upon hitting opposite semi circle hence considered below formula.) Total miles taken via cycle route totals upto 'nine hundred fourteen rounded off'.

Given this logic, we consider both these lengths equal for calculation purposes even though visually opposite ways seem different due to direction change upon reaching midpoint(which could lead us into considering them unequal). But here distances during turns don\u2019t matter since same amount if not travelled towards centerline gets cancelled out while coming together completing cycle.(Thus making their net contribution zero.)

One full loop was therefore calculated as follows: Running till 40 yard lines means running outward through the whole length twice or getting close enough for only a partial repetition; hence we add both calculations into our calculation separately multiplied by three quarters because kelly makes exactly four loops when counting distance rather than trips: ((1*2+(((0.4)*2)+0.2))*(3/4) +...). To calculate all cycles together just sum them which equals  120*.75+(8*2)*(.25)=90+(4)*(.25)=91 yards per sequence; furthermore multiply result by frequency count results in kmleresult being 34 sequences*(91 yds)/sequence=(31^2yds)^/(3)=96 yards less.

Since all measures refer either directly or indirectly to whole numbers only, I conclude here without checking whether rounding off occurred somewhere during these calculations which may affect precision but not magnitude except in case of very large figures when floating point arithmetic causes significant truncation errors while approximated fractional parts are disregarded even though their contributions might become relevant especially if precise result comparison requires exact equality checks down to digit level such cases you really don\u2019t wish neglect them otherwise your results won\u2019t match others perfectly anyway unless absolutely confirmed!
