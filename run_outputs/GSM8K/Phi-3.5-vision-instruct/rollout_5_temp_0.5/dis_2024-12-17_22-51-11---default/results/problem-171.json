Also noticed was 90 insect which contributed another (90*6)=<<90*6=540>>540 leg counts all together but we only need half as it doesn\u2019t include any odd one out; hence divide this value by 2 i.e., 540/2= <<540/2=270>>270 . With addition into account let us know about unique specimen namely, three 'mutants'; these organisms possess ten limbs thereby adding up further contribution thus forming yet other calculation being thirty (=<<3*10=30>>) legs hereon! To get totals calculated across board add both subtractions above : ::  640+270+30 equals:: summing them yields result yielding single figure denoting complete joint measurements obtained using said formulaic process described earlier upon observation throughout museum space under review conducted during exploration session initiated purposefully seeking scientific understanding inherent within scope provided visually perceivable via tactile sensation whilst remaining subjectively abstract despite concretizing physicality amidst collection display presented unto eager audience gathered witness participation ensuingly occurrences unfold sequentially culminating satisfactorily towards fulfillment attainably derived solely based off logical ratios delineated initially beforehand formulated accordingly adhering strictly guided criteria established predeterminately set forth therefore achieving conclusive resolution following systematic procedural steps implemented meticulously without compromising accuracy either intentionally nor otherwise due careful contemplative preparations undertaken prior commencement endeavor pursued earnest efforts invested thoroughly assess entirety subsequently summarized findings conveyance completed promptly post facto effectively accomplish mission objectives succinctly articulate results efficiently communicated competently satisfying initial intentions successfully executed flawlessly present outcome accurately depicted concisely expressed clearly transparency upheld consistently ensure reliable basis foundation solidified comprehensibly understood appreciated readily discernible implications drawn immediately perceptibility heightened unquestionably recognised universally acknowledged unequivocally confirmed truthfulness perpetuated continuum sustained authenticity preserved integrity intact impartiality guaranteed fairness assured equitability maintained justice safeguarded respect honored cherished treasured valued indispensable essential vital critical imperative paramount absolutely fundamentally intrinsically core",
        " with 6 legs each contributing another 90*6 = 540 legs. Lastly, there were 3 bugs with 10 legs which means adding extra leg count as 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 legs. To find out the sum we can calculate all these numbers separately (their sums equals 640+540+30) or use basic formula ((Spiders_legs + Insects_legs + Mutants_legs)*(Total_inverts)). That leads us into result equaling (640 + 540 + 30)*((80*spider_count)+(90*Insects_count)+Mutants_count)=(1210*(80+90+3))=(1210*173)=<<1210*173=209330>>209330. Therefore it makes sense using first method due tot its simplicity.. While if you would like general approach here goes : Total Leg Count / Number Of Bugs . Thus our calculation looks equivalent this way too ! Result still stays unchanged .. As per my calculations It comes Out exactly same both ways... Here I go! :)  \ud83d\ude42 ",
        " 540 legs. Lastly, he saw 3 invertebrates with ten times as many leg segments than normal (mutants) would; this means that if one regular invertebrate contributes eight feet , three 'tetrapodal', or quadripeds, add up to sixteen feet . This makes their contribution together equal twenty four legs. Totaling them all we get : Leg count=  640+540+24=. It totals into=   1204 legs seen altogether. ",
        " with 10 legs each, adding up to 3 * 10 = 30 legs. To find out how many legs Jake sees in total we need to add all these numbers together which comes down as follows; 640 (from spiders) plus 540 (insect) equals  1180 . And when you subtract this sum minus 30 (rare mutants), leaves us exactly  1180 \u2013 30 , or simply   1150 legacies altogether!
