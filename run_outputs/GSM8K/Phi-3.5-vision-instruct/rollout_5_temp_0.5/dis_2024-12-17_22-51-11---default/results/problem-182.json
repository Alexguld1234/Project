That\u2019s why although initially seemingly very complex , all one really needs know here about 'ages', besides simple math equations involving addition/subtraction operations upon both individuals involved \u2013 such information simply cannot exist without using algebraic formulas & geometry techniques within order produce logical deductions!

Since Jean is always two years younger than Mark regardless of their ages, if Mark was 19, Jean would then also have been 19 - 2=17 years old back then too.

Given Jean is two years older than Mark, if Mark is presently 21 years old, therefore, Jean who we assume shares their relative ages since no further information specifies otherwise about any birth rates change or other factors, Jean is also aged as per their common status \u2013 hence, Jean needs to just add those two extra years onto Mark\u2019s present chronological stage.

Hence it could not conclusively pinpoint either exact parental order i.e mother father first born elder son younger daughter siblings twins among others.
