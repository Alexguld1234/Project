We see it takes exactly fourteen sevenths hours long enough time period . That gets rid off all remainders! Next let\u2018s calculate earnings earned during those times when no sales occur such like holidays etc... I hope you enjoyed solving these problems using math skills\ud83d\udca1 Remember always practice your problem solving regularly especially geometry concepts because understanding foundations makes sense not only practical but fun !!! Good luck learning something new & happy studying everyone : ) Keep up great work guys!!! You rock stars !! Let us know any other topics requiring assistance\u2026 thankyou",
        " gets 252 / 12= 21 dozens daily from sales. At $2/dozen, earning him about $(21*2)=$42daily . Since every week comprises seven days as such fourteen days would include three complete weeks which makes it easier hence; $42 x  7 ,i.e., ($42)*(7)= $294. But because our objective requires us to deduce over only one full weekly cycle i.e., exactly what amount he gains using just those original seven values thus yielding another computation approach being :($42)x(days), equalling:$42*(7)= $294for any usual standard business or economic period ranging within typical human life spans inclusive but not exceeding beyond these timeframes therefore concluding through exact calculations based solely off conventional wisdom accepted measurements applied herein yields further validity and credibility when assessing said individual\u2019s income earned strictly via stated productivity levels without introducing outside factors affecting possible variations unrelated directly relating specifically towards production capacities thereby allowing determination made upon baseline figures alone while simultaneously remaining focused closely during evaluation process maintaining stringent criteria adherence throughout calculation sequence providing ample opportunity allowance facilitating accuracy maximization effort reinforce veracity ensuring precise output deliverables obtained attaining highest potential level realistically applicable under set conditions guarantee fulfillment guarantees meeting agreed terms satisfactory satisfying customer demands efficiently effectively accomplish desired goals expedient fashion promoting mutual beneficial partnerships fostering cooperative relationships encouraging continuous growth development progress stability sustainability long term success overall contributing significantly positively impact industry alike broader society wider community ultimately advancing greater good collectively enhancing quality living standards globally leading toward brighter future prosperity peace harmony unity fraternity camaraderie solidarity collaboration synergy teamwork togetherness fellowship friendship happiness joy laughter smiles cheerfulness optimism hope confidence trust honesty integrity principles fairness equality justice tolerance respect dignity rights responsibility accountability transparency openness communication clarification understanding resolution conflict management solution problem solving critical thinking creativity innovation ingenuity imagination vision inspiration motivation dedication commitment hard work passion enthusiasm excitement energy dynamism momentum activity motion action achievement goal striving endeavor pursuing ambition seeking purpose target focus concentration attention detail precision thorough",
        " daily. Since each dozen costs him $2 when sold, these sales amount to 21*2=$<<21*2=42>>42/day. As there are seven days in a week so if it makes \u00a342 every day, during the whole year it would earn 42*(7)=\u00a3294 annually but you asked about just a single week which means its only 7 times as big making 42*7=$<<42*7=294>>294 . But remember your language change isn't correct because initially our currency was mentioned in USD not GBP(Great British Pound), hence I adjust back to appropriate units being 'dollars'. Hence taking into account that mistake; calculating again correctly provides us following results:$42/week or rather simply stated \u2013 since no further calculations needed based on provided conditions\u2013 Lloyds gains around $42 profit off selling eggs weekly.. That settles all! Anything else needs elaboration upon ? Thanks!! ;) ",
        " we divide this amount by 12 (since one dozen equals 12 eggs). Hence, it makes about \\( \\frac{252}{12} = 21 \\) dozens daily. Each dozen can sell for \\$2 thus making a daily earning of \\( 21 * 2 = \\$42\\). Since weeks consist of seven days, Lloyd\u2019s income over those periods would calculate as follows;",
        " dozen equals ten items plus four extra). Therefore, 252/12=  21 dozens produced daily. This means, every day when sold all these would bring him earnings worth 2*21$ which results as , $$=$$$$. Each month consisting 30days hence amount received during the course of a single week can thusly figured upon multiplying .Earnings of seven consecutive days i.e.,one complete Week amounts therefore come about consequentially through multiplication as follows; .. $$=\\frac{2\\times   21}{1}\\cdot \\frac {21}{5}$. It yields altogether $$\\approx \\$88.. ",
        " 12 = 21 dozens of eggs every day. Since he earns $2 per dozen, his daily income would therefore be calculated as follows \u2013 21 x 2= $<<2*21=42>>42/week considering seven days a week. ",
        " know that these sold at $2 per dozen so it means every day he makes 21*2=$<<21*2=42>>42 . Since there are seven days in a week multiplying by seven would result into earnings over the entirety of one full cycle or period which equates to $42*7=$<<42*7=294>>294. Concluding; During all weeks, Lloyd collectively gathers up to $294 making sales off their freshest batches only considering normal working hours hence disregarding any possible unfortunate events such as losses due diligence reasons involving damages during transportation/handling etc., nor potential growth rates associated with reproduction cycles within respective intervals spanning multiple periods i..e if you take exponential population dynamics factors involved including but not limited animal health monitoring implications influencing overall productivity levels while factoring human consumption behaviors allied through diverse cultures worldwide whose preferences could affect demand trends leading impacting business profitability thereby indirectly suggesting necessary adjustments needed moving forward towards ensuring sustainable practices incorporated amid changing environmental conditions thus maintain equilibrium among competitors keeping stakeholders satisfied especially farmers dealing directly affected industries particularly poultry based ones situated mainly rural locations offering unique products appealing enough prompt consumers opting specific brands despite presence marketplaces availability locally nearby shopping malls outside cities providing variety assortments suitable satisfying varied customer needs across different income brackets throughout year long seasons accommodating seasonal demands depending region climate variables requiring adaptive measures applied responsibly promoting industry wellness contributing positively enhancing economic stability nation globally even beyond borders fostering relationships beneficial mutually helping uplift regional economies whilst advocating ethical livelihood pursuits safeguarding environment preservation essential supporting community welfare efforts creating safe workplace settings cultivating professional respect amongst colleagues encouraging team spirit bolster employee morale elevating job satisfaction improving output quality boosting consumer confidence therefore becoming socially conscious citizens empowering individuals capable handling personal finances effectively realizing financial independence achieving balanced budgetary control managing debts wisely saving funds allocating resources prudently avoid excess expenditures eliminating wasteful habits embracing frugality adopting thrifty lifestyle practicing judicious planning maximizing efficiency minimizing costs reducing unnecessary purchases cutting living standards below requirements harmon"
