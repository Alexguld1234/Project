By combining those expressions mentioned above since 'the amount Gold (G)' minus something equals its own value plus thirty `(G-(G-30)=30)`, while multiplying everything times negative twelve makes `-(-12G+(12*30))=-12*(G-(G-30))` simplifies downward until only constants appear behind parentheses such as '-12*``-18``=``'`.
