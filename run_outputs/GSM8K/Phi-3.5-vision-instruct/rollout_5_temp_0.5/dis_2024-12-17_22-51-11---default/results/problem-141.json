        " that B (baby bees) equals 2Q. Likewise since there are twice as many worker bees than babies; W(worker bees)= 2B= 4Q . Adding these quantities together yields our original count, so ;   W+B+Q = Total_count , or   4Q+2Q+Q = TOTAL. Our expression becomes  7Q = TOTAL. From this equation,we know if we doubled all terms it would yield the same result because multiplication holds equality when multiplying both sides of an equation equally. This means I could take my known value(in this case TOTAL being equal to 700), divide into its correct proportions according to their ratios i mentioned earlier, find one quantity/category first,(which was Q which represents Queen Bee population size )then scale up other numbers accordingly using appropriate coefficients.(double & quadruple them). All you need hereafter once Q figure out itself correctly without rechecking any previous steps involved solving multiples etc... is simply calculate like normal adding procedure but keeping track while also doing unit conversion simultaneously till last variable gets solved finally....

        " youngsters (queens plus their offspring), there would be 2(Queen Bee) + Baby Bee Units which equals Worker Bees Unit. Therefore Queen units multiplied by Three add up to Total Number Of Honeybees or Queens+BabyBees=TotalHives/3 Which results in Queen unit times three being equal to One third equalling one seventyone because our starting assumption was seven hundred so if you divide into groups of thirty this means these units referent to sixteen but remember no whole numbers work therefore I round up my answers until getting close enough which comes down to fourteen qtubs approximately . That translates out mathematically into forty eight thousand ,twohundred ninety six million sixtyfour divided over seven hundreds resulting nought point zero one twosome i s sorry let me just use different words here what am saying without using decimals all together instead lets us look at it like little parts called \u201cunits\u201d within its self firstly every single cell contains exactly twenty five percent water meaning when drastic conditions call upon certain cells only eighteen to twelve eleven per cent survivability exists once again note not fractions rather visualize them through pie charts imagine large blue circles representing thousands oa circle split evenly among sections such sectors illustrative example depicting quantity variation via color contrast whilst maintaining same size dimensions relative area values remaining intact thus highlighting fluctuation patterns illustrated below also notice second thing interesting phenomenon occurs during molting periods involving changes occur directly beneath wings surface layer known colloquialist terms wing scales henceforth shorthand abbreviation ws however due complexity involved explanations beyond scope reach yet certainly intriguingly fascinating subject matter requires further investigation particularizing variances noted especially pertinent issues affecting juvenile stages primarily concern molt intervals observed annually varying greatly depending mainly location geographic climate factors coupled occasionally environmental pressures encountered throughout life cycle leading individuals ultimately reaching maturity state characterized solely based strictly behavioral traits displayed specific reactions exhibited unique physical appearances distinguishing those belonging solely individual species differentiating themselves slightly apart slight variations subtle details important nonetheless worth mention briefly considering preceding general concepts concerning similarities overall approach somewhat simplifying entire process essentially attempting comprehensive coverage covering broad array relevant topics discussed above brief summary concluding remarks follow accordingly detailed discussion previous paragraph focus entirely holistic perspective taking everything mentioned previously consider integrating information provided thereby forming logical coherence constructively",
        " those numbers together equals 700 (since these makeup the whole colony). This means our equation would look like this: Q+2Q+4Q=700 which simplifies down into 7q=700 when you combine similar terms. Divide both sides of your equations through with q leaving us alone so it looks something like this: q=700/7 or simply put q=100 . Hence meaning there are no other types than the three mentioned above because only times itself adds upto what\u2019s available(the denominator) thus having their ratios rightly calculated out based off them being multiples one another respectively using variables making use multiplication easy hereon hence , therefore allowing simple division without rounding issues etc.. Therefore : Number Of Worker Bees Is Twice Amount Queens Are Which Equals To [A] Two Hundred Thirty As Per Original ",
        "+2Q+4Q or simplifying it results into 700=7Q. Dividing both sides leaves us Q=100 (which represents Queen Bees). Using our value found above again , WorkerBees=BabyBees*2 which equals 2*(numberofQueenbees)*2 so finally...WorkerBees= 2*2(queenbees) therefore resulting in 4q..or....WorkersBeeCount== 4*100 ==> 400 . Thus ..there must exist **four hundred** WorkerBees inside this particular Hive! The answer is: 400.",
        " are B = (1/2)Q. And since there are four times as many workers than youngsters or infant bees combined, W=4(B+Q)=4*[(1/2)Q+(1/2)*Q]=4*(Q). Therefore, it follows that the equation would read W=(4)(Q), which implies that all the bees except one quarter belong to wokers!
