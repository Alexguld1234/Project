Thus, among all eligible ones\u2014the initial twenty minus four taken care off by both types\u2013 we get only 16 - 4 = sixteen choosing hip hop.

Consequently the conclusion stands thusly : Given any context involving numerical data regarding groups within larger collectives \u2014 like our case scenario concerning distinct categories based on preference inclinations towards various disciplines practiced upon musical theatre genre styles --you can discern appropriate distribution patterns using elementary arithmetic operations while simultaneously drawing conclusions rooting primarily around basic principles governing proportions relative positionality amongst different subsets derived hereinafter through said quantitative evaluative process.

This means out of the original group, this amount represents all those still able to pick another style apart from Classical; i.e., if Jazz was picked it would equal exactly one fourth hence leaving three quarters as potential applicants eligible for Hip Hop. Thus multiplying your available choice pool across these four segments yields :   \\( \\left( {{\\frac{4}{{{N}} \\choose {2}}} } \\right)\\times\\left( {\\frac{3}{{4\\text{ }}-\\left({\\frac{4}{{{N} \\choose {2}}}\\right)} }) }\\right)\\) .

This means 16 - 4 = 12 students opted for hip-hop dancing. To find out what percentile those 12 students represent amongst all students, we calculate it as follows: (number_of_hip_hop)/(total_students)*100%, i.e., (12/20)*100%=60%. Hence, 60 % of the whole group ended up joining Hip Hop classes. The answer is: 60. ",

To determine what percent(out of initial group size), it equates as; let 'x%' equal those selecting Hipp hop over our original collective summed up to yield , . x%=12 out of 20 or simply write fractional notation representing same quantity like so : $$\\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{3}{5}=60\\%$$ Hence only $$60\\text{%}$$ of all available kids chose hiphop",

Since neither \u2018contemporary\u2018 nor \u2018jazz\u2019 forms overlap because every student choose just one style of dancing it results into having exactly half of the initial population opting for \u2019hip hop '.

Translated thusly to percentile terms yields around 60%. Therefore, overall, about 60% of all participants engaged only in hip-hop styling. This can also easily showcased through direct addition since initially subtracting both the relevant numbers related beforehand derived quantities pertaining specifically regarding either Jazz or Contemporary artistic forms reduces effectively overlapping populations towards establishing sole practitioners specializing within the particular realm encapsulated under 'hip hop'.

Since all others chose Hip-Hop, everyone leftover thus equates to roughly equal numbers assigned to every single dancing form apart from the one most popular choice here namely ,contemporary . To know what fraction belonged into classical category you need therefore subtract off both percentages considered previously i..e .(i) Controversial %+ (ii)jazz %).
