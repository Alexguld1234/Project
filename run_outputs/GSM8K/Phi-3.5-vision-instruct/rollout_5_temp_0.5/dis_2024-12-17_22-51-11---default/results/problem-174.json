Therefore, as you calculated above before being corrected: It would require around forty plus hours which equals sixty full minutes if rounded off. As suggested earlier, rounding down gets us close enough without overstating because when dealing with actual physical tasks like preparing food items, precise calculation might not always hold due to various reasons including task interruption etc., hence I suggest sticking to approximation rather than precision here unless otherwise specified in problem context.

        " amount of time per potato (about 1.5 minutes or 90 seconds), we can add these times together for simplicity. However, since the actual rate varies slightly depending on which task you look closer at -- peeling versus slicing--the overall completion would depend upon focusing first either purely on peeling tasks before moving onto dicing ones; henceforth combining averages rather than strict timings isn't precise enough here as no information was provided regarding if 'mixing methods'-peeling->cutting OR just dedicated towards any single method exists within contextual data available presently! Therefore let me calculate based off average timing alone\u2014ignoring efficiency gains due mixing techniques over course duration involved throughout process execution phases mentioned earlier i .e Peeling & Cutting Potatoes...it results into finding out required elapsed intervals covering entire activity span using sum divided across set quantity defined explicitly below including breaks taken amidst activities while performing manual labor intensive operations such food processing involving physical tools/equipments like vegetable choppers commonly used household appliances designed specifically tailored craftwork producing desired outcome product type specifications demanded clientele satisfaction goals established corporately amongst business entities undertaking retail trade industry sectors offering goods commodities sold via wholesale distribution networks promoting wider customer reach benefitting economic landscape marketplace dynamics influencing commercial behaviours encouraging competition fostering innovation enhancement quality performance improvement initiatives driving positive growth trajectory forward sustainable development ensuring viability longevity durable infrastructure facilities supporting societal wellbeing enabling human resource capabilities leveraging technological advancements optimizing operational efficiencies streamlining workflow procedures maximising output capacities thus minimizing waste disposal costs conserving resources preserving environment mitigating greenhouse gas emissions protecting biodiversity safeguarding natural habitats reducing carbon footprint adhering international standards regulations conformity guidelines implementing best practices environmental management systems tracking key metrics reporting progress monitoring effectiveness evaluation adjustment refinement align stakeholders interests balancing benefits equitable opportunities accessibility universal design principles inclusive education fairness integrity accountability transparency collaboration synergism team spirit camaraderie cooperation trust relationships partnerships building bridges mending divides breaking walls down erasing boundaries conquering challenges embracing change adapting resilience learning lessons growing evolving transforming inspiring creativity fuelled motivation passion igniting fl",
        " significantly longer than just slicing (a minute and a half compared to 5 seconds). However, if we want precision including the actual timing needed while considering every action separately\u2014not assuming simplifications due to 'roughly equal' conditions stated initially\u2014we would calculate as follows: First convert minutes into seconds for better comparison; this results in Peeling time being \\( 90 \\) seconds/potato \\((90s)\\) because you said peeling took approximately one and three quarters (\\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\)) or ninety seconds.\\nNow add the slice down time which was provided clearly:\\(\\text { Cutting Time Per Potato }=~5\\) Seconds Therefore,\\nCombine those times together:\\\\[ T_{total}=T_{peeling}+T_{cut} \\\\]\\n\\\\[T_{total}\\\\] becomes:\\\\[\\begin{aligned}[t]{ }\\qquad& = 90+5 = 95\\, \\, {\\color{",
        " Firstly convert 1.5 minutes into seconds which equals 90 seconds (since 1 min=60 sec). Secondly calculate the full cycle (pealing and cutting)time ,which totals to 90+5=95 seconds or approximately .one hour forty-five minsand thirty four secs(this isn't feasible as stated), because this exceeds human capability during working hours.(However considering just Peeling would result in almost 9hr duration, while Cutting alone results around less than  1minute ) Therefore calculating based purely off the data provided, using realistic work limits suggests either timing error regarding 'about', suggesting further clarification needed or assuming no break/rest times; if solely focusing on estimated value without factoring physical limitations \u2013 Potato prep could theoretically stretch over several unrealistically extensive periods beyond average daily practice limit!

        " in a minute (so 1.5 min \u00d7 60 sec/min). Thus, if a whole potato took approximately twice as long to peel compared to being chopped\u2014given their ratios--the average time taken would equate closer to this ratio applied evenly across tasks i.e., averaging around ((1*90)+(2*5)) / (1+2) \u2248 [(90)*3]/3= 90 secs which converts back to 1.5 mins. As such, assuming no downtime or interruption, estimating based upon similar activity rates over six sets \u2013 equivalent to the quantities stated within your scenario\u2013results in just under an hour when considering multiples necessary due to equal handling duration among identical objects without regard toward efficiency improvement via task stacking during periods absent primary operational intentions other activities like storage sorting etc..
