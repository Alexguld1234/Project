Knowing that her neighbor provides only one source of those eggs, divide it into groups of the initial supply provided per round (i.e., 9). Hence 45 divided by 9 amounts to exactly 5 rounds before being able to gather all required eggs to proceed with making up the mentioned count of flans, assuming no egg spoils or gets wasted throughout these operations as well. Therefore, since both sources provide same kind of commodity hence you need not worry about running out of other supplies while considering them separately during math calculations involved herein too!

Instead let us go back further into reasoning assuming full batches mean everything received during those hours counted towards making upwards till twenty egg collection maximums before considering potential partial collections next hour when necessary until hit target goal; meaning within first roundings off maybe around halfway through second session \u2013 still incomplete yet very close since overshoot wouldn't save points nor extra effort spent!
