Since every tree lives approximately three times as long when cut due to increased growth resources available (so effectively one chopping equals subtracting no additional space but conserving natural life span), we can treat them differently than living ones; hence only considering actual removals makes sense here too--in other words removing both new additions plus current population altogether leaves fewer dead rather if none existed initially.. Consider all these factors together --for example tom\u2019s family may grow large enough during those decade(five+) decades while still keeping alive most or even all grownup trees despite having so little start capital ($) allocated towards establishments like orchards/gardens themselves without need supplementary funds later provided via governmental aid programs which could finance such projects through grants subsidized donations etc\u2026 Thus , instead using just pure math calculations based purely upon quantities alone ignoring contextual nuances might lead us astray completely since reality often doesn\u00b4t follow ideal scenarios exactly nor always work logically anymore according historical evidence...
