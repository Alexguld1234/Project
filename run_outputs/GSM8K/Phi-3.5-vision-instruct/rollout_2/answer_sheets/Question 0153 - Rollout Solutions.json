After eating 14 fries, Dave is left with F - 14 fries.\n2. The seagull eats half of whatever Dave has left, so Dave adds those back because they were stolen: (F - 14) + 4 = F - 10.\n3. Three pigeons eat 3 fries each. This means 3 * 3 = 9 fries are taken. So Dave subtracts another 9 from the current amount: (F - 10) - 9 = F - 19.\n4. A raccoon takes away two-thirds of what remains, which can also be written as (2/3)(F - 19). This means 2/3 times fewer fries than Dave currently has, or (1/3)(F - 19) remain.\n5. Finally, one ant steals a fry, leaving 5 fries. Therefore: (1/3)(F - 19) = 5. To find F, solve this equation: multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: F - 19 = 15; thus F = 15 + 19 = 34.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
