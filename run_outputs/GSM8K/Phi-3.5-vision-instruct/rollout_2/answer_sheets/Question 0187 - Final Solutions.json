That would be the initial amount of money owed, which is $100 according to Condition 1. Since Condition 2 mentions monthly compound interest but doesn't provide enough information about any payments being made or received before interest calculation, we assume no additional transactions occur other than the interest accrual. Therefore, after three months, assuming no repayments have occurred yet (which could affect the exact amount), the formula for compound interest is P(1+r)^n, where P is the principal amount ($100), r is the monthly interest rate (2% or 0.02 as a decimal), and n is the number of periods (3 months).
