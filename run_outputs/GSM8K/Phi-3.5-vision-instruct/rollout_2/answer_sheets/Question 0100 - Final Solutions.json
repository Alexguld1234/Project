We know they pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so if the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, the third friend pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times.\n\nNow add up all the presses: 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) equals 175 doorbell presses in total.
