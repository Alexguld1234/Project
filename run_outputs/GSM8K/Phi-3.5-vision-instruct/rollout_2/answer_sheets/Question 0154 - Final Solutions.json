First, we need to calculate the total hours spent in classes during the weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). Since Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each day, it amounts to 3 hours/day * 3 days = 9 hours per week. Then, let's find out how many hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He has 2 two-hour classes each day, which totals 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day * 2 days = 8 hours per week. Combining these, we get 9 hours from the weekdays plus 8 hours from Tuesdays and Thursdays, resulting in 17 hours per week. In a semester of 16 weeks, 16 weeks * 17 hours/week = 272 hours.

Firstly, we calculate Monday through Friday's hourly classes which amounts to 3 classes * 1 hour/class * 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) = 9 hours/week.
