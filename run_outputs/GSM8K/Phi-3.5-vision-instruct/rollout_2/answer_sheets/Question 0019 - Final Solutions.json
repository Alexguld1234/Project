Marissa walked 4 miles in the first hour and then 2 miles in the second hour. That makes it 4 + 2 = 6 miles so far. The entire trail is 12 miles, which means there are still 12 - 6 = 6 miles left. If Marissa wants to finish at an average pace of 4 mph over the whole trip, she needs to complete these last 6 miles in less time than if she walked them at her current speed because she\u2019s already taken longer than needed. At 4 mph, walking 6 miles would take her exactly 1.5 hours or 6 / 4 = 1.5 hours. However, since she can only use the rest of this trail period plus any additional time beyond the required 1.5 hours, we must subtract the time spent so far (which was 2 hours). Therefore, the maximum amount of extra time she can spend walking is 0.5 hours or 30 minutes. Thus, Marissa needs to cover those remaining 6 miles as quickly as possible within the time constraint. \n\nThis solution is based on the assumption that Marissa continues to maintain the same speed until reaching the end of the trail.
