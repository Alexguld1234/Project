Let's say the number of baby bees is B, so the number of queens is B/2 (since there are twice as many babies than queens).

Firstly, note down that the first instruction contains a hint which isn't part of the solution process described earlier but instead provides additional information not directly used in our calculations. Therefore, it cannot be included when solving the problem according to the instructions provided. With this understanding, let's solve the question without considering Hint 1.\n\nWe know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. This means if you denote the number of baby bees as 'b', then there would be twice as many worker bees, denoted as '2b'. We also know there are twice as many babies as queens; thus, if 'q' represents the number of queens, then 'b' equals '2q'. Combining these relationships yields q + b + 2b = 700, simplifying into 3b + q = 700.\n\nGiven that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, b = 2q. Substituting 'b' with '2q' in the equation above, we get: 3(2q) + q = 700, simplifying further to 7q = 700. Dividing both sides by 7 results in q = 700 / 7 = 100. This tells us there are 100 queen bees in the hive.\n\nSince there are twice as many babies as queens, b = 2 * q = 2 * 100 = 200. And finally, since there are twice as many worker bees as babies, b = 2 * b = 2 * 200 = 400. Thus, there are 400 worker bees present in the hive.
