First we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each, which is 20 * 2 = $40.00. Next, let\u2019s figure out how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs for 20 candles. Each pound of beeswax yields 10 candles so 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax are needed. The supply cost for one pound of beeswax is $10.00, therefore for 2 pounds it would be 2 * 10 = $20.00. Subtracting this cost from the revenue gives us the profit before accounting for any other costs (like packaging or shipping). So the calculation goes like this: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00. Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00. The answer is: 20.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.

Each candle requires one pound of beeswax and wicks, which costs $10.00.
