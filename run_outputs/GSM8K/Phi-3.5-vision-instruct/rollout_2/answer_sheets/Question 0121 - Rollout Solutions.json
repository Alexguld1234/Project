Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, making a total of 13 fruits. Kael brought twice as many apples, which means he brought 5 x 2 = 10 apples. And since he brought half the number of oranges, it would be 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Kael brought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits. Adding both amounts together, 13 (Morisette) + 14 (Kael), we get 27 fruits in total.
