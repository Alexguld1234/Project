Then he reads for half that time, so 2 / 2 = 1 hour. That makes it 3 hours per session (2+1). He does this 3 times a week, which totals 3 * 3 = 9 hours a week. Over 4 weeks, it would be 9 * 4 = 36 hours spent on TV and reading. The answer is: 36.", "value": 0.84375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.
