Now let's analyze condition 2; it says that the quantity of rubies is 35 less than that of diamonds. Therefore we can calculate the amount of rubies using formula Rubies = Diamonds - 35, which equals 175 - 35 = 140. Moving forward to condition 3, it states that there are twice as many Emeralds as Rubies. Thus, the number of emeralds would be calculated as Emeralds = 2 * Rubies, equating to 2 * 140 = 280. Summing up all the gems together, the total count of gemstones in the chest would be Diamonds (175) + Rubies (140) + Emeralds (280) = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.
