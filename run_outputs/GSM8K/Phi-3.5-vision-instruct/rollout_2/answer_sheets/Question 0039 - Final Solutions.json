[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.

First, we need to find Dana's walking speed. Since she skips at half the speed of running (which is 3 mph), her running speed is twice that, so 3 * 2 = 6 mph. Now, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed, which means it's 6 / 4 = 1.5 mph.\n\nNow let's calculate how long she runs and walks during those six hours. One-third of six hours is 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours spent running. Two-thirds of six hours is 6 * 2/3 = 4 hours spent walking.\n\nSo, while running: 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles\nAnd while walking: 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles\n\nAdding both distances together: 12 + 6 = 18 miles. Therefore, in six hours, if Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she would cover 18 miles.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
