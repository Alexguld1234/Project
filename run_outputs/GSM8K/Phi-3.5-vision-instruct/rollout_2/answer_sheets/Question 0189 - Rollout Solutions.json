First, let's find out how much they paid for tickets, food, and rides separately.\nTickets: $20.25 (as mentioned)\nFood: $2.25 (as calculated above)\nRides: $33 x 2 = $66 (as per hint)\n\nTotal cost: Tickets + Food + Rides = 20.25 + 2.25 + 66 = $88.50\n\nSince there are three friends, divide the total cost by 3.

Since it cost $4.50 less than tickets ($20.25), then it would be 20.25 - 4.50 = $15.75 on food. Next, let's add up everything spent together (tickets, food, and rides). That includes 3 tickets ($20.25), $15.75 on food, and 2 rides at $33 each ($66). Adding these amounts gets us $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102. The three friends need to split this amount evenly.
