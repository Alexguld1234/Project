Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, if Brooke is X years old, then Seth is 2X years old. When they both add 2 years to their current ages, we get: (2X + 2) + (X + 2). According to the hint provided, this equals 28. Now we solve for X using the equation: (2X + 2) + (X + 2) = 28. Combine like terms: 3X + 4 = 28. Subtract 4 from both sides: 3X = 24. Divide by 3: X = 8. So Brooke is 8 years old right now, meaning Seth, who is twice as old, is 16 years old.

We can set up equations based on the information we have: S = 2B (because Seth is twice as old as Brooke) and S+2 + B+2 = 28 (their combined age in 2 years). Substitute S=2B into the second equation, getting 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28 or 3B + 4 = 28. Solving this for B, we get B=8. Since S=2B, substituting back in gets us S=2*8 which means S=16.
