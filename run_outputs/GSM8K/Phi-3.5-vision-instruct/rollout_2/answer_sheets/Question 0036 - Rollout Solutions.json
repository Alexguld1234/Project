First, we need to figure out the price of one yogurt when it is on sale. At 4 yogurts for $5.00, each yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25. But since we know each yogurt actually costs $0.80 ($4.00 / 5), this shows us the deal was good as he gets them cheaper than their normal price. \nNext, we calculate Terry's daily expense. As he eats 2 yogurts a day which cost him less due to the sale, so these 2 yogurters together cost him 2 * $0.80 = $1.60 every day.\nFinally, we multiply his daily expense by the number of days in his consumption period (30 days). So his monthly expense would be $1.60 * 30 = $48.\nTherefore, Terry spends $48 on yogurt over the course of 30 days.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
