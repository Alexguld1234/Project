[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.

Firstly, calculate the revenue earned per day. On Thursday, the mechanic earned (6 tires * $60) + (4 tires * $40) = $360 + $160 = $520. On Friday, only car tires were repaired so the revenue was (12 tires * $40) = $480. To find out which day had more revenue, we compare the two amounts. $520 > $480. Therefore, the higher revenue was on Thursday. The difference can be calculated as $520 - $480 = $40.

Firstly, we need to calculate the daily earnings based on the provided conditions.\n\nOn Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires which cost 6 * $60 = $360. And he also fixed 4 car tires costing 4 * $40 = $160. His total earning on Thursday was $360 (truck tires) + $160 (car tires) = $520.\n\nOn Friday, he fixed 12 car tires. Since no truck tires were repaired, only the cost associated with car tires needs to be considered here. That amounts to 12 * $40 = $480.\n\nNow let's compare both days:\n\nThursday: $520\nFriday: $480\n\nThe difference in revenue would thus be calculated as follows: $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40. This means the mechanic earned $40 less on Friday than on Thursday.\n\nHowever, if you ask by what amount more the mechanic earned on one day over the other (given it\u2019s just a comparison), the answer would technically be negative because Friday didn't exceed Thursday.

On Thursday, the mechanic made $360 from truck tires alone (since no car tires were repaired), while on Friday, the mechanic made $480 from just car tires. Since neither day included repairs for the other type of tire, these amounts represent only the income from those specific tires.\n\nNow let us compute the difference in earnings between the two days based on one type of tire repair only. First, subtract the Thursday earnings from the Friday earnings for truck tires. This results in $480 (Friday earnings) minus $360 (Thursday earnings), equaling a $120 increase in earnings due to truck tire work. However, since the question asks about the overall increased revenue rather than just comparing the same types of repairs, it suggests looking at the summed up earnings across all types of tires per day.\n\nOn Thursday, considering that no car tires were repaired, the total revenue was solely contributed by the work on truck tires, resulting in $360. On Friday, the total revenue came exclusively from car tires work, which led to $480. To determine which day yielded higher revenue, simply compare the totals: $360 on Thursday versus $480 on Friday. Given this comparison, Friday generated more revenue.\n\nTherefore, the mechanic earned $480 on Friday, which is greater than the $360 earned on Thursday.
