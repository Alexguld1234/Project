Jamal's phone holds 6 times as many photos as Brittany's, so Brittany's phone holds 1800 / 6 = 300 photos. This amount is also equal to 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks. To find out the number of ducks, we divide the number of birds by 50: 300 / 50 = 6. The answer is: 6.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1:  Jamal's phone capacity is 1800 photographs, which is six times greater than what Brittany's phone can store. Condition 2: Brittany's phone storage capacity corresponds to 50 times the quantity of ducks depicted in Jamal's photo taken at the zoo. Question: How many ducks are featured in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Firstly, according to Condition 1, if Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can store 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs. According to Condition 2, Brittany's photo storage equals 300 photographs / 50. Therefore, there would be 300 / 50 = 6 sets of ducks in one of Brittany's photos (assuming 1 set includes all ducks in her shot). Thus, since we don't know exactly how many ducks make up one 'set,' but knowing that it's multiple of 6, let's assume 1 set contains 6 ducks as per the logic provided\u2014a safe assumption considering we're working through a hypothetical scenario based solely on the given information without specific details about the exact layout or groupings within Brittany's photo. Hence, Jamal's single photo featuring ducks likely includes around 6 ducks under these assumptions.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
