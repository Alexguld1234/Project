The problem states Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lost half their volume when turned into sauce, we need to double the volume of sauce to get the original volume of tomatoes used. So, 32 ounces x 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes were originally used.", "2": "Determine the volume per can. Each 16 ounce can of Tomatoes contains three tomatoes. We know that 64 ounces divided by 16 equals four cans needed for 64 ounces.", "3": "Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans. Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can. In this case, it would be 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.", "4": "The answer is 12.", "5": "Freda used 12 tomatoes."}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume.

First we need to find out how big the original tomato batch was before it became sauce. If 32 ounces of sauce came from a 16-ounce can that contained three tomatoes (thus making 4 cans), then those four cans reduced to 32/4 = 8 ounces. This means that the reduction factor due to cooking is 16-8 = 8 ounces. Since this is 4 times the size of one can, the fractional volume of the tomatoes reduces to 8/16 = 1/2 or .50 of its initial size. The answer is: 1/2 or .50", "value": 0.5}, "ost_step": {"1": "To get back to the original amount, you must double the current amount; therefore Freda used 2 * 32/2= 32 Tomatoes.", "2": "Since each can contain 3 tomatoes, this means Freda used 32/3 = approx. 10.67 or approximately 11 cans of tomatoes.", "3": "The answer is approximately 11 cans of tomatoes."}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
