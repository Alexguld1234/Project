Firstly, let's find out how much money was spent on items other than the boxes of pizza.

To find out how much money was left for the pizzas, subtract these amounts: $50 - $33 = $17.\n\nNow, since each pizza box costs $8.50, divide this remaining amount by the price per pizza box to determine how many boxes she could buy: $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes.

Since each pizza box costs $8, dividing the remaining amount by the price per pizza gives us $17 / $8 = 2 boxes (with $2 being unaccounted for).

First we need to find out the total price for items other than the pizza. We know that the chicken meal costs $12. Next we calculate the cost of the milk which is 5 times $3. That is $3 x 5 = $15. Then we add up the cost of the apples which is 4 times $1.50. This equals $1.50 x 4 = $6. Adding all these amounts together, we get $12 (chicken) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33. To find out the cost of the pizzas, subtract this sum from the total amount paid, so $50 - $33 equals $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, divide $17 by $8.50.
