[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's assume there are 'x' silver coins, so the gold coins would be 'x + 30'. Together, all these coins add up to 110. So we get x (silver) + x + 30 (gold) = 110. Simplifying this equation gets us 2x + 30 = 110. When you subtract 30 from both sides, it becomes 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2 results in x = 40. Since x represents the number of silver coins, Gretchen has 40 silver coins plus 30 extra gold coins, which means she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.
