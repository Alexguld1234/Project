John started with 13 Lego sets. He earned $195 from selling them. Since he ended up spending $160 on video games and had $5 left, it means he didn't spend all his earnings. We know he had $35 extra after buying the video games. This means he must have kept this excess as savings. To find out how many Lego sets he still has, we subtract the number of Lego sets he used to buy video games from the initial amount he had before selling any sets. But first, let's calculate how many sets those $35 represent since we don't know exactly what percentage of the sales went into saving and what percentage toward video games. Assuming equal distribution of purchasing power across both items, the calculation would involve knowing the exact split.

Then he planned out his spending which totals $160 for the video games plus having $5 left over, so the total amount was 160 + 5 = $165. To find out if he can afford it without breaking into his savings or other resources, we need to compare what he sold his Legos for ($195) versus what he spent on video games ($165). Since he earmarked $165 specifically for this purchase, he didn\u2019t go over budget as $195 (Legos) > $165 (Video Games), meaning he still has enough money remaining for both the Legos and Video Games. As per the information provided, he hasn't mentioned any new purchases beyond the Legos and Video Games. Hence, the calculation doesn't affect the initial count of Legos, which was 13.

He spent this amount on 8 video games at $20 each, which costs him 8 * 20 = $160. After purchasing these games, he ended up with $5 left over. This means before buying the video games, he had 195 (from selling) + 5 (left over) = $200. Since he spent $160 on video games out of the $200 he had, he must have had 200 - 160 = $40 remaining when he decided not to buy any more games.\n\nNow we need to figure out if he spent it all or only part of it on toys. We don't know exactly how much was spent yet. But since he has enough money to buy another set without spending all of it ($15), it implies that none of the money was used up for toys \u2013 it remained as unspent money.
