Firstly we know the total population of the city of Soda is 23786. We also know that it includes 8417 men. Therefore, the sum of women and children equals the remaining population after accounting for men. To find out the number of women, we subtract the number of men from the total population: 23786 - 8417 = 15369. Next, since we know the exact count of women already, we need to calculate the difference between these numbers: 15369 (women and children combined) - 9092 (women) = 6277. Hence, the number of children in Soda is 6277.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants.
