The building has 120 units in total (condition 1). The current occupancy rate is 3/4, which means 3/4 of these 120 units are occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we multiply 120 by 3/4, getting 90 units occupied. To get the unoccupied units, subtract this from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units. Therefore, there are 30 units in the building that are still available and not occupied. The answer is: 30.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
