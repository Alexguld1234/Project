With net income of $12 per year (after subtracting the costs), we need to find out when the initial investment will be paid back plus an additional profit. We divide $90 by $12 per year: 90 / 12 = 7.5. Since you cannot have half a year as a full year count, we round up to ensure he covers all the costs within the next complete year. Therefore, it takes 8 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The answer is: 8.", "value": 0.75}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
