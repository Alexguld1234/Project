Next, since we know it costs $80 per dozen for the cupcakes, but only want to buy one dozen (since minuets aren\u2019t mentioned), therefore just multiply 1 by $80; this equals $80. Finally, similarly multiplying quantity and unit prices also applies to these last 6 packs of mini cheesecakes as well so using 1*price_per_dozen*$number_of_doneskies you get 6*cost_cheesecake=$55= \"$330\" .
