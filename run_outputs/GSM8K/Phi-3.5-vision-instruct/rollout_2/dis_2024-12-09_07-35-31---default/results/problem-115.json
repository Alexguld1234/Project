So if old market price is \u2018x,\u2019 current market can rise as `(old price*increase)/(1+tax)` => `($10*$5/((1+$0)+$0))` therefore making `$5/$1` yielding doubled amount being `$10`.

But let us proceed based purely off provided figures/ratios as per instruction requirements below... With similar pricing logic applied towards other wooden material sets too before subtracting potential loss margins due market dynamics adjustments post purchase periods(including taxes)- assuming flat linear rate changes across different products types irrespective future events affecting values henceforth beyond specified transaction dates..

As such, if she sold everything together, using no other information than supplied here above i.e., ignoring expenses related to transportation or anything else aside as well, her combined earnings would still merely suffice reimbursement losses due to inflated pricing -- meaning zero net profit overall . No matter whether we combine quantities individually like calculating 'two times fifteen plus four,' simply adding values won't work either because every product category faces different degrees changes relative impact over time resulting distinctive variations among individual items themselves compared against collectively measured whole sums thereby skewing true gains vs loses outcomes significantly therefore need correct adjustments taking place beforehand via calculation methods employing specific rates applicable according circumstances mentioned earlier within said case study itself including incorporating potential extra fees possibly being applied henceforth accordingly depending largely upon respective geographical locations involved which may vary greatly across countries worldwide albeit often following similar trends nonetheless keeping exceptions always present yet frequently occurring occasionally whenever unpredicted events unfold globally affect global economy broadly based ones mostly especially those happening rapidly recently becoming prevalent evermore constantly increasing daily further expanding widening reachability simultaneously rendering even faster spread wider dissemination generally everywhere wherever possible anywhere practically feasible essentially universally encompassing virtually entire planet earth completely almost entirely throughout vast majority population segments around globe inclusive particularly relating individuals belonging indigenous tribes residing remotely far away places deep interior regions less developed economies lack infrastructures minimal services provided technologic advancement lagging behind leading edge western societies highly industrialized nations rich areas urban centers crowded metropolitan cities bustling commerce hub international trade gateway mainstream financial districts busy corporate halls head offices skyscrapers luxurious hotels posh villas fine cuisine elegant restaurants grand mansions sprawling estates lavish parties exclusive soir\u00e9es celebrations galore champagne flowing copiously sparkling wine glass filled brimming full contents overflowing abundantly pleasures indulgences fantastic fun exciting thrilling experiences fabulous occasions marvelous spectacles magnificent display performances splendid sightseeings extraordinary visual arts exhibitions glorious artwork masterpieces breatht",
