Next, let's determine how often the third friend rang the bell; this happens 10 more times than what the fourth one did \u2013 so if your fourth friend rung once, you get a sum like below :   60+10=70. Finally, add all these results together along with the initial pressure made by Jerome\u2019s first guest(pressures):    20 (first friend)+25 (second friend)+70 (third & fourh guests)= 115 . Therefore, Jerome\u2019s visitors created 115 ringing sounds against his front door while being present inside house or backyard during their short stay time.<|end_of_instructions|> ",

        " 5 = 25 times. Next, since the third friend pressed twice as often as the fourth friend whose count was provided directly; which equals 2 * 60 = 120 pressings. Adding all these together yields 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 120 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend), equaling 225 pressures altogether. ",
        " their count depends on the fourth friend\u2019s which was provided as being 60 presses. Accordingly, the third friend would then hit twice what the fourth one did since it says '10 times more', so the third friend pressed the button 60 \u00d7 10 = 600 times. Adding all together, you get 20 (first friend) + 25 (second) + 60 (fourth) + 600 (third). Hence, altogether during these visits, they made 20 + 25 + 60 + 600 = 685 ringing sounds through your home speaker system!
