To sum everything up correctly you would add them first (i.e., before subtracting) because your question didn\u2019t specify exactly if this means just one group among others or both groups separately altogether!. Therefore since I understood wrongly my previous instructions let me rewrite again properly below without confusion:) \u2013\u2013 Correct calculation goes : Both persons(anakin+locsin)= 13+(total)+6=(total). Hence solve equation results show us clearly everyone took different numbers based off individual counting methods yet combined count reaches 16 when put back side by side meaning our original assumption holds correct here showing once merged counts reach accurate figures easily enough allowing easy tracking no matter whom whose hand held what item during gathering process..

Finally it caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin (3+2=5) which means only this type increased; other types stayed same as count for Anakin or decreased lesser compared. Thus Total summed up amount of all these animals can therefore summarized using following set equation Together_Total=(StarfishA + StarfishL),(SeahoresA + SeaheorsL),(ClownFishA + ClownFisHEL)=(10+5)+(6+3)+(3+5)=15+(9)+(8)=32 Fish altogether Hence ",
        " 3 fewer sea horses (6 - 3), so that means he got 3 seahorses as well. And since locsin caught 2 more clownfish than anakin who caught only one, it became three too; thus totalling up all together being : 5+3+3=11 fish per Locsin.. Therefore their combined haul was 19(anakin) + 11(locsin)=30 fish altogether! ",
        " this question first before answering next part about locsin\u2019s other types of fishes since both parts requires using different quantities obtained from Anakin (first problem) which are only related when comparing them directly against numbers mentioned previously but not vice versa as their quantity doesn\u2019t affect one another or depend solely upon it hence making comparison difficult due its dependence rather comparisons based on difference/addition i.e; \u201chey if you take away my stars plus yours\u201d logic won\u2019t work because amount affected depends greatly unlike simple numerical values such as counts etc... Next let us tackle Locsin\u2019s haul considering above stated fact here\u2026 What happened exactly while trying figure out whether anyone else besides Anakin actually knew what was going wrong during our second analysis phase(see point three)? We began examining all available sources again looking specifically within those relevant sections containing either direct statements regarding specific details provided earlier like so therefore eliminating even possible references indirect indications altogether ultimately leading into confusing scenarios involving mixed up variables causing confusion thus disproving claims being made throughout previous investigation process..

        " same approach as before based on what was explained above; hence I found both answers (using subtraction) below... As previously mentioned, locsin also took three less seahorses compared with Anakin which means he managed only four because six minus three equals 4 And lastly he acquired merely double those of Anakins Clowns due to being told just one other extra meaning seven since ten times two plus another adds up to seventeen To add all these into totals together becomes equaling simply eleven plus twenty equalling thirtyone therefore my concluding result here would state They gathered altogether fifty eight different forms if creatures during their aquatic adventure alongside our local shores this morning..

Similarly, Locsin captured only 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 sea horses because it was said that Loices collected three lesser marine life types compared to those snared by Anakin. Also, since Anakin took home four lemon sharks while locsin picked up just one extra additional relative, this indicates that Anakin seized six whereas Locsin grabbed seven creatures including half a dozen scorpion fish as well as twenty jellyfish species plus eight dolphins which makes fifteen overall.

Lastly, since Anakin collected 3 coral animals, this time it says locsum has gathered 2 additional ones compared to him; therefore, Locsam was lucky enough to collect only  3+2= 5 species altogether. To obtain the overall quantity of aquatic creatures both individuals picked up over their seaside adventure, you simply sum all these amounts together as follows :  Anakin found 10+6+3 = 19 living things . Locusam discovered merely 5+3+5 = 13 different forms of marine life . And finally adding them yields us , or putting everything into equation form ; Total_amount = Starships(Anik)+Horses_swimmers+(Locsum) = 19 + 13 = 32 This implies our resulting value stands correct thereby completing our solution process without necessitating any further operations/calculations beyond what I\u2019ve already carried out above ",

Since Anakin captured 6 sea horses while Locsin found 3 less i.e., (6 - 3) so both totaled up as follows; their combined catch was therefore calculated this way; Starfish: (10+5=15), Sea Horse:((6)+(3)=9) Clownfish : ((3)+((3)+2=5)) Hence summing it all up,(15+(9)+5);equals 29 This implies collectively they managed to capture forty four pets altogether .

As per problem statement , locsen caught lesser amount all over hence subtract this subtraction(LocSen-)from overall counts already counted (overall), which totals to ((overal)-LocSen--)=Total FinalCount..

Adding both amounts leads us to get a grand amount resulting into  19 starfish/crabs /ladybugs etc., so finally counting all the marine species together their combined result would hence add upto 19(starfish)+13(other marines)= 32.
