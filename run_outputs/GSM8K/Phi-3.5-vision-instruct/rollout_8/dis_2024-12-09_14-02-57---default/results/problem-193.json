These six whited flamingos brought up the count of other colors making it equal so if we want calculate the difference between all nonwhite colored objects compared to whites here would suffice: as this time only new flamingoes came into place being untouched which totals 18 again plus previous amount equals :  2*(amount removed) + current value ,that makes us conclude following numbers   18+x+(18-(x))=(x*2)+(18). Simplifying further you get    36=18+x .
