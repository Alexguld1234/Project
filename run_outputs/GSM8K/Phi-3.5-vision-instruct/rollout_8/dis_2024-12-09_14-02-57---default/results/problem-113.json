The correct way around would involve understanding exactly what was asked i.e., calculating all instances which happened over time (which includes both successes & failures), before excluding one category using subtraction.

        " over 15 days he would plant 15 \u00d7 2= <<15*2=30>>30. But only half grew (or about) which means it was around 30/2 or approximately ~15 growing bushes when asked later since both fractions reduce down equally as well although their values differ slightly due to rounding differences but our initial value choice isn\u2019t affected either way). Since you wanted specifically \u201chow many?\u201d rather than percentage wise answers here let me just say therefore...so yes indeed one could reasonably assume Ryan still nurtures those original non blooming specimens regardless because nature doesn\u2019t typically discriminate based off such things even though this might mean future harvest prospects may diminish slightly hence good planning regarding what variety type gets sown initially matters greatly especially considering potential germination rate percentages impact yield figures accordingly; however without further specific details nor clarification needed thus far shall refrain myself yet again simply stickwith math logic alone unless otherwise directed upon receiving additional instructions! :) ",

Here since all units involved i.e., time (days), quantity related(flowers) don\u2019t need any type conversions like speed would require converting km/hr into m/sec etc; hence this situation doesn\u2019t include any requirement of Unit Conversion operations. Next follow order BODMAS which stands as Brackets Outer Digits Multiplication Addition Subtraction Parentheses Orders Division First solve addition division multiplications inside brackets first ,then multiplication additions outside . Hence here no bracket exist also so next move forward following operator precedence rule 'Orders', nothing relevant present about powers involving exponential expressions thus moving further according our process simple multiply numbers together followed adding finally subtracting lastly due to subtraction part included calculate using basic arithmetic steps : Ryan planned  2x15=<<2*15=30>>30 flower plants but unfortunately only half grew successfully meaning actual grown successful florals becoming out of equation being stated previously its count becomes minus point wise getting computed yield result as [tex]output=\\boxed{25}[/tex].

When calculating average yields per unit area or volume during experimental processes involving substances like food preservatives(say) or agricultural fertilizers used directly on soil surfaces around fields prior knowing actual quantities consumed precisely makes sense but still often isn`t feasible due constraints arising mainly owing scarcity either temporal nor spatial reasons leading scientists resorting themselves occasionally upon theoretical approximations based fundamentals principles governing related disciplines thus pushing boundaries further exploring new horizons..
