Later one went further into its refuge so finally among those who stay near or around him it becomes: 5 - 1= 4. Hence remaining ones including both moved away could not seen individually nor stayed close enough making calculation inconclusive based off information provided. However if we interpret question as asking about still being present i.e taking initial count (before any movement) removing hidden thus calculated result stays valid without explicit addition/subtraction operation resulting value remains unchanged: Total observable Tadpole Count currently would hence remain same assuming original sighting before relocation activity concluded prior inquiry timeframe.

        " him with (11+6) = 17 visible ones. But later, 2 hid behind rocks so we need subtract those too. That leaves us with (17-2)= 15 visible tadpoles altogether. ",
        " 17 tadpoles before any hid away. However, when 2 of those reappeared later beneath a rock, it means these same ones just moved but remained within sight count. Therefore, adding back those 2 makes Finland able to count all seeing still as",
        " question since no other information indicates changes occurred afterwards. The remaining unseen ones (under the rock) don\u2019t affect our count because it was stated these hid but still exist within sight which means initially counted as part of 'swimning'. Therefore Finn could currently see up to 17 tadpoles in the pond. "
