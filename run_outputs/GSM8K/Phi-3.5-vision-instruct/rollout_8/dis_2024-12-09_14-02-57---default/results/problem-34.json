Hence, Siobhan has exactly those same amount because we know right away what Aaron has since all their quantities differ only based off of Raymond or one another\u2019s quantity as opposed to something completely different like just random things multiplying etc.. Therefore our result can simply directly state both amounts; thus making it easier understanding especially when working out such problems within textual answers alone . Thus 'both names equal'.
