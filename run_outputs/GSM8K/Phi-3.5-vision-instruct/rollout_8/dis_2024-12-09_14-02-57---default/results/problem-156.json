Therefore, if everything was accounted correctly (assuming no excess or deficit occurs), the zookeeper needs to order exactly these amounts of bananas. Hence, it can not go wrong because our calculation only relies on known data without any uncertainties provided so the ordering might as well require precisely those figures mentioned above i.e., 1400 bananas worth ordered twice since zebras don\u2019t exist here henceforth; but even considering possible fluctuations due perhaps storage methods etc wouldn't affect overall calculations based strictly off supplied information indicating quantities required over definite periods assuming consistent consumption rates \u2013 thus leading us directly toward concluding 'no error'.
