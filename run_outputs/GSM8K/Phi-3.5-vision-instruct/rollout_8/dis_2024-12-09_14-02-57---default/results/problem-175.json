        " question about the actual income first before answering any other part! To calculate earnings based on sales price Juan and Carlos earned per cup ($0.5) multiplied against cups sold (for this calculation I am assuming here that all produced juice was consumed since no waste or loss ratio info exists). Earning rate comes up to $.5 times 20 cups which equals \\$10/gallon sale value.. From there determine profits (\\$25): Profit level subtracting expenses yields $\\{Revenue\\;-\\;Expense\\}~$=$\\{$Total_revenue-$Per\\_Gal_{Cost}x(Number \\;of\\; Gals)\\}$~=$\\\\$(Profit)/Unit\\$. Solving this equation provides Revenue / Unit\\,i.e., $\\{[$(\\text{\\$25}+[$25 x $(Price/gallon))])]\\}/unit$, so if you plug Numbers into this formula you would find out Number Of Gallons Produced By These Brothers Before Their Sale Event Occurred i\\.e.$2[(($25)+[(-1)(($5)]))\\]/((-.5)=4)$. Substituting back onto our original revenue calculations reveals that brothers need \\\\{(AmountEarned)-({Lemon+}{Sugar})\\\\}^{total volume}\\\\$.

        " ignore sugars costing which leaves just $3 (spendings solely from buying only lemons). Next determine sales revenue generated. Each cup was sold for fifty cents ($0.5), so twenty cups amount up to twice this sum i.e., $0.5*20=$10. Therefore, calculating net earnings subtracting expenses reveals them being able to generate profits equal $(twice$the coffee price) $-(lemon& sugar comb)$expense=($10-$5)=$5 . And since they earned $$5$, consequently dividing through both sides yields our result : $\\frac {$$5}{} =\\frac {$$3}{}$costof lemons , thus concluding that half or $$\\frac{5}{5}= \\boxed{\\mathbf{$1\\hspace{0.5em}$}}is what juan & carlos allocated toward purchasing fresh fruits namely; yellow citrus segments otherwise known popularly as;\"lemons\"\".

Therefore, if one gallon which earns them $5 requires lemons worth exactly half price compared to producing full value because they also add up twice as needed quantity due to lower usage efficiency than premade mix.

But regarding exactly determining **the** cost ,this info wouldn\u2019t be sufficient .But maybe I misunderstood ; Any clarification could help ? Well indeed my apologies :] It turns out our task requires only understanding if any meaningful numbers derived via calculations here qualify themselves rightfully within its bounds ! Alright let me explain why\u2026    To recap things briefly once again:::) We know:- Cost Per Glass := Sale price/revenue_perGallon [$0.5/$10],which yields result r1:=CostPerGlass===>r1<|endofstatement|>[$.005].And based off earlier reasoning...that indicates every individual item contributes ~ 0 percent towards overall gross output value !! That might sound insane but consider ..if those sold items represented fractional parts compared side against bulk purchase discount rates ?? Like when buying pencils en masse..discount stores often offer big boxes containing hundreds individually packaged sticks\u200a\u2014\u200awhereupon comparing unit rate values alone don\u2019t properly convey true savings gained \u2019cause purchasing lots cheapens / reduces pricing effectively\u2009\u2060\u00ad\u2009\u202f\u200ato reflect wholesomeness over fragmentation And due too mathematical rounding differences plus human interpretational biases \u2014such nuances become blurred henceforth creating ambiguity Here lies contradiction because such anomaly shouldn't exist according to",
        " one gallon makes them 20*0.5=<<20*0.5=10>>10 dollars. To earn $25 in profits, this means their revenues minus expenses need to equal $25. Given revenue (per gallon) already exceeds cost (per gallon), Juan & Carlos used all ingredients once; therefore spending was exactly 5 $. The answer is: 5.",
        " would come out as earnings minus cost price ($25). That means $25 equals revenue (10) plus variable production expenses(X), hence X = 25-(10)=$15 spent on varying material. But this doesn\u2019t include fixed overhead or marketing fees etc., let alone splitting profits amongst Juan and Carlos if applicable. Nonetheless only focusing strictly within these constraints leads us specifically back to our original question; 'how much was spent solely on LEMONS?' With all things equal across iterations & assuming no other additions/deductions beyond just raw materials \u2013 sticking closely aligned along those lines leaves your initial proposition undisputable : both spending amount equally divided among brothers . Thus , we conclude here ; without need further calculations nor adjustments regarding distribution mechanisms due lack sufficient information provided \u2014 overall direct consumption remains unaffected thereby maintain consistency throughout entire series progression regardless changing circumstances encountered during course timeline development phase therefore ultimately determining actual precise value still rests squarely upon stated premise itself i.e one dollar twenty-five allocated directly towards ingredient acquisition via purchase / procurement effort yielded initially prior proceedings described under subhead accordingly validated thus substantiation established firm foundation groundwork requisite ensure comprehension achieved accurate calculation performed successfully resulting correct outcome obtained reliably confirm accuracy attained indeed !!! ",
        " know Juan and his brother made enough profit ($25) divided by the profit per gallon (5), which equals to about 5 gallons sold together as round numbers aren\u2019t considered here since actual sales may not align perfectly due to decimal profits or unsold amounts. But let\u2019s compute precisely without assuming full use of all parts. We don't consider fractions because typically you can't purchase a fractional part of materials \u2013 they would only buy whole gallons if needed completely. Thus, effectively focusing solely on our calculated integer result rather than any implied additional non-whole production/purchasing cycles within these financial confines, this equates simply to purchasing exactly those units contributing positively towards reaching said earnings goal considering no wasted material cost beyond what\u2019s necessary based strictly off net gain figures provided thus far sans overlapping partial batch calculations suggested via typical sale metrics divisibility normatively enforced when evaluating revenue through itemized transaction counts i.e., 'per individual unit'.
