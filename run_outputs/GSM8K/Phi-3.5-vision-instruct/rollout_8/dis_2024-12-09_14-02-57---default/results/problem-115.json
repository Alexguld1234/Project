        " five 4x4x10 boards; since these were purchased before the price increase, their original value was half what it is currently worth due to the 50% raise\u2014so instead of being valued at (original amount) plus another 50%, they\u2019re only sold as if having increased by 50%. That suggests calculating this sum without increasing its current ($16/board): therefore, fifty percent growth implies multiplying $(original_amount*multiplier)*(sum($cost/$price))=(1+percentage_increase)(cost)/current_value=($(1+(50/100)))*(($100+$16*$5)$/(number_of_items). Simplifying reveals ((1+50%)=$<<((1+(50/100)))*(1)=1.5>>), which signifies one dollar represents a fractional proportion equal to (proportion = percentage / thousand). Put simply \u2013 every item carries weight proportional to itself relative to other items whose combined monetary equivalent adds together when grouped similarly or comparable. To find such ratios using division first identify units used most frequently throughout comparison points like lengths etc.). Hence dividing both sides equally yields ratio=. Rounding off slightly makes calculation quicker because fewer calculations needed during actual pricing situations may yield similar results but perhaps faster computation times depending upon whether rounded numbers prove accurate enough according scale differences involved here otherwise round estimates might lead us astray further than anticipated considering possible variances among different stores offering various product mixes often affected greatly via seasonality & inflation rates generally causing disruptions affecting supply chain logistics overall making consumers pay higher fees per unit through indirect taxes collected largely benefiting corporations rather directly distributing benefits widely distributed amongst society collectively acting toward economic stability goals ultimately fostering innovative ideas ensuring continuity amidst changing business environments while maintaining fairness under strict consumer protection laws safeguarding individual rights protecting customers against unfair practices prevent exploitation allowing freedom within marketplace constraints promoting healthy competition based solely primarily focused around maximizing shareholder profits creating environment conducive helping companies remain competitive driving constant evolution adaptive strategies facilitating adaptation improving products services deliver unlimited choices stimulating entrepreneurship inspiring greater creativity spark igniting imaginations resulting broader horizons leading advancements transforming entire economies into prosper",

Therefore saying \u2018profitably sale\u201d here implies getting rid off products whose remaining estimated resale values equal precisely initial investments(purchasing expenses) involved initially buying goods..

New cost for original units calculates into being 10 units times their updated value; hence it amounts to 10*$15= $150. Likewise, new worth of other ones follows similar equation too but this time we start counting only about those present currently(as sold), thus making calculation equal to five units multiplied by fresh rate resulting in getting $100.
