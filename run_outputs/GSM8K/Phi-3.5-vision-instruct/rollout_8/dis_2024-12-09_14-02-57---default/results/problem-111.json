However knowing specific methodology involved still helps guide decision makings going along direction chosen thus reducing risk factor associated specifically relating calculations necessary completing all respective tasks successfully according guidelines set forth preceding question asked priorly ..

Since initially without getting affected over hours since hourly unit isn't asked just need its relative proportion so divide these numbers into fractions whose denominators make up totals adding individual rates being 'rate*distance'.
