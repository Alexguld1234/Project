Adding these proportions results into Total Bees = Q+2Q+4Q => This simplifies further upcomingly to ->Total Bees= 7Q , which ultimately translates to; 7Q == 700 .

Therefore your equation becomes :  2*W+W+(1/2)*(2*W)=700 i.e. , or equivalently,   5*w=700 . This implies w=(700/5),which equals exactly 140. Thus,there exist precisely 140 worker bees inside such mentioned Hive structure! Hence our solution suggests correct application of basic logic concepts like Relation among different variables represented herein terms 'queen', 'worker,' & so forth upon simple numerical substitution methodology..So if one wants those little buzzing creatures taking care of business rightly under human control ..know about royal hierarchy first before diving deep into management aspects !!! ;)  The answer is: 140."
