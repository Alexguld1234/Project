Thus, Rosie could potentially clock up a significant total of fifty miles whilst adhering strictly within your initial provided schedule of seventy minutes into full operation encompassing any speed or rate parameters set forth during their work duration..So yes ,in this scenario you really get almost every possible outcome assuming optimal conditions !
