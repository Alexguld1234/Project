First start pulling apart power function expressions involving sums (+/-)\\*, difference (-+) division(*) etc.; look closely whether combining anything may lead indirect help discover underlying properties involved here ??

First thing first note here : \u201che spent $200\u201d , implies either=x+y ($200) => no indication whether X refers directly towards quantity but if Y indicates direct relation wrt Prices implying furthermore assuming units represented above mentioned costs respectively yields us having just these parameters involved thus making them prime ones thereby leading ourselves onto simple algebraic approach(solving simultaneous equations involving variables relating both Price Per Unit alongside Total Amount Spent.)
