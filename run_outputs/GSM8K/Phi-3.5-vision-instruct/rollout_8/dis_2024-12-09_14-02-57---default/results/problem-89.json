        " so we multiply it by (3 / 4) :  16 times(3 / 4)=$x$. We solve this multiplication first using fractions or division notation ($=4 \u00d7 12$) , which yields \\$48. This means about $\\dfrac{48}{1} \\times {2}=$$\\mathbf{\\boxed{\\fbox{$96}}}$ could go into buying gifts since these cost $$${{ ${2}}} $$\\dollar{}each.$ Change not needed here as all funds would likely cover what is required according to question prompt.) The answer is: 96.",
        " hence (16)(3/4) equals  12 attending. Based off this result we can find out exactly how many gift packs need buying. Because as said above every arriving person gets one present set. And since everyone only receives half presents accordingly it follows that all these people get (n(n\u22121))^\u00bd=((12)(12+1))^1\u2044\u00b2=(12*13)^1\u2044\u00b2. Thus you calculate approximately seven sets, which means seventeen individual items when considering round numbers, thus christinas spends approx.(7).(.5)$. Fifteen sixteenth dollar signs equal three full price gifts plus additional uncovered cost if applicable , namely fifteen times twenty cents or thirty cent addition to those initial thrice ten dollar sum making altogether fortyfive dollars sixty cumulative expenditure herein described below.

        " At parties, you prepare one personal item (a drink or appetizer) for every third person as well\u2014about another quarter of all persons present plus themselves; this leaves about three quarters minus half again over those amounts... Since we know Christina only expects people showing up instead if being turned away, therefore it doesn\u2019t matter which portion goes toward these other items either\u2026 It just means fewer gifts need making! So let us assume everyone brought something like cake slices but no candles since none seem included here when asked specifically regarding whether anyone else brings anything besides food onto their own listings within question text paragraph itself prior mentioning both types mentioned above combined across multiple categories including costumes etc.).

        " needs one gift bag; therefore, divide 12 by 1.25 which results into approximately  9.6 or practically rounding off as ten since you can\u2019t purchase half a pack. Each package costs $2 so multiplying it out, \\( \\$2 \\times 10 \\) gets equal to $\\$20$. Hence the cost would indeed come out to twenty bucks without taking tax! Thus, if including estimated tax rate(say about ~10%) could raise it roughly around `$` `22`. However remember these calculations depend highly upon precise details & may vary accordingly. Conclusion:-For simplicity sake let alone complications like inflation rates over time etc., best estimate according presented scenario stands : 'Expected Total Cost=$$\\$$ 20'. Note such estimates never guarantee exactness due inherent uncertainties involved any financial decision especially relating parties!! Finally always consult expert whenever possible when actually making purchasing decisions involving personal finances.. Good luck buddy ! ",
