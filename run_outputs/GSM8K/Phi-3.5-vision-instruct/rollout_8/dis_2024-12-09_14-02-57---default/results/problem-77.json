It stated that Raymen does one fourth the weight Laurel throws into their clothes line. Thus it means Laurel takes up twice as long working (and thus doing) Laundry than Remaunna who also works slower since rayman isn\u2019t spending all his time watching movies like himself.

Next deduce the volume managed by Raymond who undertakes precisely half compared to the responsibility borne upon Sarah every single time; hence double David\u2019s assigned part to figure this portion \u2013  1*2 , so the resultant quotient sums up to twice as large again representing Raymond doing exactly one quarter of all laundry being taken care off. Hence summing the differences among these individuals means subtracting either smaller individual loads(Raymond &David) from largest(Sarah);i.e,. taking away smallest unit value divided amongst three people represented numerically becomes equivalent to finding square root((x\u00b3)^\u00bd)=\u221a\u221bx=(cube_root(square_root(\ud835\udc65)))which here translates into computing ((400/3)^\u00bd)+1+[(400/(3^3)]\u22121 meaning roughly about 33% less than raymond plus another third minus yet another other one fourth fraction equals approximately equaling ~11%.
