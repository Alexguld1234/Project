Hence, based off our calculations indicating no monetary benefit when opting not to go ahead, even taking into consideration earnings opportunity forgone through time investment while managing own returns , decision making might suggest sticking with self filing despite comparatively small financial outcome against broader professionalism & convenience gains associated with engagement third party service assistance .

Hiring an accountant costs $90, so compared to the opportunity cost (losing wages), it turns into only a net gain because we subtract both amounts together; hence   $90 - $105 equals negative $. Therefore, instead of saving any additional funds through paid labor when considering earnings alone, she ends up experiencing just slight savings as opposed to losses overall upon opting to employ professional help over self-service which makes her less financially secure concerning individual gains via personal expertise usage versus external assistance expenditure.

The answer is: 195.",
        " Hiring the accountant costs $90 while not working means potentially earning less than expected\u2014$105; therefore subtracting both values can show us which option leaves Jackie better off financially. Doing own calculations we get : (potential gain \u2013 possible losses) == (income made outside when no self help)-(self assistance fees): $105-$90=$15 difference meaning Jackie ends up winning due to lower expenditure involved as opposed saving time .
