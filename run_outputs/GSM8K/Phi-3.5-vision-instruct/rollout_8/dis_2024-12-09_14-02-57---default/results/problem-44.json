This calculation seems incorrect as we already know that making each candle doesn't require fractional amounts or complex calculations but simple multiplication due to 'pounds per candle'. Let me correct this oversight.) To find out exactly how many pounds of beeswax Charlies requires to produce 20 candles knowing it takes 1 pound for 10 candles, divide these quantities directly which would result into 20 / 10 = 2 pounds. At $10 per pound according to the question, supply costs come up to 2*$10= $20. Knowing also each sold candle fetches him $2 meaning revenue obtained when all twenty get offloaded comes down to 2*20 = $40. Net earnings achieved upon subtraction of expenses from income therefore stand at $40-$20=$20 gain overall; however considering only gross revenues without accounting individual item sales margin isn\u2019t always possible especially since pricing could change subjectively over time hence taking actual market situations under consideration wouldn\u2019t affect said figure quite heavily barring any dramatic changes thus maintainability throughout business cycles stands affirmed even though not explicitly acknowledged herein assuming static parameters prevail during examined period thereby confirming validity albeit cautiously).
