        " groups (clusters) containing 20 fruits per cluster.

It would mean (6) x (20)= <<(6)*(20)=120>>120 items per group or set because there was six groups/clusters altogether as indicated above. Each item contains one berry so this comes out like 120 raspberries plus another (67=<<67=67>>). This equates into 187.(total count not rounded off!) Total summing up those numbers yields us ((120)+(67))=(<|output_answer_88|>), hence when adding them together you get **187** Berries! Thus our output value becomes \\boxed{187}. Another way I could possibly interpret your question statement may lead me down different problem solving path; such interpretation results in slightly differing calculations based upon whether grouping counts individually versus solely using single units only . Nonetheless , both answers converge near enough closely around hundred range territory making discrepancy quite minor ..if any !
