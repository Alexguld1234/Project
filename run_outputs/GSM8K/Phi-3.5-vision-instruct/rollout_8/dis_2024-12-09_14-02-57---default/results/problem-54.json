        " That means Patchy also had 7 (initial) multiplied by 3 which equals 21. Since one single count represents all those four groups combined i.e., both adult female cats\u2019 newborn babies plus adoption ones we get it as 7+21=28 or another way round would be; Initial Kittens(adopted)=7 ; First Cat\u2018Adoption Amount'(Patchy)=3*7={21}; Second Cat New Born Cats='Trixie'=12 Summing these values {7+(21)+12} results into equaling{40}.

        " 3 = 36 (adopted) kittens. Combine this result with Trixie\u2019s own birth of 12 kittens equals overall new babies: Total Kittens=Patchy+Trixie; Total Number Of New Babies=(36)+(12)=Total ",

That means we can conclude; this douggable batch brings out the happy babies count... 7 + 12 + 36 equals ... let me calculate.. uhh... it adds up exactly to .... yes you guessed correctly!... 55 adorable miniature furball snuggles. And since everyone knows if math ain\u2019t your strong point \u2014 fuzzy paws herein signify zero (Zilch), so remember next time Uncle Bert doesn't tell no lies 'bout numbers even though sometimes doubting yourself like Sherlock Holmes could help avoid miscalculations resulting in less fluffing opportunities but better bonding moments instead.

        " many offspring Patchy has: since it was three times as many, multiply 7*3=<<7*3=21>>21. Combine all together we find that these newborn babies brought the count up thus far to: initial adoption plus births equals <<21+12+7=38>>38 animals (since only dogs contributed). ",
        " had three times as many adopted ones compared to what was already adopted (which we know because it states 'thrice'), you simply multiply this value; therefore get Patchy\u2019s count through multiplying 7x3=<<7*3=21>>21. Combine both counts, so your current sum would equal 21+7 or <<21+7=28>>28. To account for newly born kittens, add these too but keep separate since no amount provided about newborns; hence only considering existing ones, currently, the family can comfortably care for twenty eight individual kitten members without needing any resources beyond provision made solely based off previously described factors excluding additional birth figures not quantified within premise parameters herein under scrutiny presently evaluated upon executional fulfillment undertaken systematically whilst adhering strictly guided protocol regulations observed per established industry benchmark metrics thus far documented throughout various research papers circulated amongst relevant academic circles globally via online portals including numerous scholarly articles available free public access databases spanning multiple disciplines encompassing diverse specializations ranging across comprehensive gamut extending virtually totality",

That totals up to 28 plus another 12 belonging to Trixie equals  28+12=40 . Therefore, the Doubtfire family currently owns 40 kittens.. The answer is: 40.",
        " 21 kittens for Patchy. Add these together along with those who came directly because you start counting right away if someone told us both parents already made babies before being counted: so add up all the counts starting immediately including the called ones \u2013 i mean not wait until later like waiting ages sometimes happens people say!

To solve this expression correctly according\u00a0to your question here would also need using summation formulas such Squared Sum Formula or Generalized Arithmetic Series but still can\u2019t avoid basic algebra operations since arithmetic series relate back somehow too depending what exactly needs calculating\u2014which again depends heavily upon context within problem scenario itself; however without specific numbers provided either way seems impossible\u2026well hope everyone makes sense haha :D !!!!!!
