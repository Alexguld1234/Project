Multiply your initial sum(the result just derived which refers back to the previous operation)=180/ 100=(180 /100). Subtract using these values \u21d2 [ ((180 /100)-3)] x 100=[(( (180/100))-(3))]*100=.

Thus when finally calculating, divide the resulting figure further into thousands :-thus dividing by thousand [[(( (180 ) \u2013 ([[(180)/100]-3])))*100]/1000].

Altogether we get First Month\u2019s Downloads(First One )+Second Month Downloadss+(Third month)=Total Number Of Downloads During Three Weeks   Combining them all up ,we get; Total=60+180+126 Hence our solution Is : ",
        " decreased by 30%, which means it went down by (30/100) * 180 = 54 downloads. Therefore, the dowloads during this month equal 180 - 54= 126 downloads. Adding all these together \u2013 initial six zeros plus other individual digits equals exactly summing up them manually or using calculator leads us directly into finding correct result automatically; Hence we can simply add everything without writing every single digit individually since adding zero doesn\u2019t change anything\u2014just move numbers along corresponding column(digit position).
