On Wednesday, since she wrote double what she wrote on Tuesday, this results into 2 x 7 = 14 articles written on Wednesday alone. Given all these numbers; hence, over the three days combined, she created: 5 (monday) + 7 (tuesday) + 14 (wednesday) equals twenty six artcles altogether during those few days.
