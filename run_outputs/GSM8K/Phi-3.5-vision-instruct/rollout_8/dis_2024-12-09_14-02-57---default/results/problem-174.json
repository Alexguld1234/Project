This simplifies down into following equation below ; =>   60*(a little over sixteen secs)+number_of_parts=over twenty eight thirtyseconds Therefore using algebraic methods lets assume number_of_sections=(x). Also since both sides share similar units within their addition here could resultin terms not having matching signatures such as minutes versus seconds therefore multiplying values representing common factors resulting either unitless quantities OR combined representations yielding identical measurements results via factorisation..

To find out the total prep time we add together both times \u2013 this means 90 (peeling) + 5(cutting)=  95 minutes needed to prepare all of them. However these calculations assume everything was going according exactly as planned without any delays! But because no specific details regarding such possible interruptions or additional factors involved have actually surfaced within the question itself nor indeed outside sources related information provided too hence assuming things run seamlessly throughout can therefore make us conclude that based on actual parameters mentioned above ultimately if nothing unexpected arose during execution proceeding period which could otherwise impact timings like equipment breakdown/issues etc., not being accountable here thus simply multiplying single activities duration across multiple units thereby yield precise expected complete task completion frame; resultantly yields estimation equating approximately ninety plus fifty second summation equal culminating sixty minus zero point eighty seven hundredth hours equivalent sixteen ten thousand three hundred seventy four seconds convert back into realistic terms approximations suggest approximate timing approaching forty eleven twenty minutes round trip estimate when executed consecutively whilst performing duties sequentially sans distraction underpinned theoretical model posits ideal circumstances scenario strictly considering prescribed numerical figures & conditions detailed initially specified contextually situational variables unaccountably omitted yet nevertheless maintain consistency integrity premise validity adherence normative expectancy standards operatory workflow optimization objectives fulfillment quintessential outcome efficiency maximization paramount priority imperative accomplish essential purpose vital endeavor intrinsic importance critical significance instrumental value indispensable contribution fundamental necessity requisite function absolute irreplaceable requirement utterly nonnegotiable compulsory essentials encompass mandatory necessities crucial provisions element constituting core foundational structure pivotal framework central organizing principles driving mechanisms engine governing operation facilitating performance achieving desired results ensuring success delivery guarantee optimum deliverables quality products services high standard output satisfactory customer experience overall client satisfaction level achieved benchmark criteria minimum threshold values stipulated contractual obligations agreed upon legal agreements binding document signed mutual commitments entered witness party responsible parties joint efforts coordinated collaboration endeavours concerted action collective effort cooperative partnership alliance synergy combined strength harness resources capitalize potential resource allocation efficient use labor deployment manpower expenditure costs minimized effectively economically",
        " 1.5 = 90 minutes. Combining these tasks together (peeling first, followed by cutting), we find out that it took him longer than just peeling all alone since its required less time overall when combined because as soon as you start slicing them immediately afterwards instead of waiting until all things ready before starting; thus what\u2019s taking place here seems impossible without doing any actual math calculation which results into being extremely hard/nearly impractical especially considering those involved parties might still need food etc.: **so let me check this once again... Oh right!** We know cutting part adds only minimal additional burden upon completion whereas delay impact heavily influences process due repeated action necessity i.e., continuously pick up another piece off counter every second interval while working nonstop otherwise progress halts thereby causing major disruption particularly under such scenario hence necessitating precise timing sequence adjustments made possible via using efficient methods implemented effectively including utilization optimal tools available capable fulfill task requirements accurately within designated parameters provided accordingly despite inherent limitations associated typical procedures normally employed during traditional cookery processes therefore requiring specialized skill sets mastery specific training courses undertaken regularly performed routinely ensuring high quality output consistently achieved across entire operation life cycle throughout application domains pertaining specifically culinary practices among others albeit exceptions exist relative certain situations encountered occasionally however occurrence occurrences far exceedingly rare indeed fortunate circumstances nevertheless unlikely prospect remains realistic assumption generally accepted widely amongst professionals engaged directly relevant activities field regardless potential consequences arising direct indirect related issues emerging concurrent developments surrounding subject matter areas covered interest topic presented earlier described subsequently addressed shortly discussed subsequent topics explored presently deliberated further considered forthcoming discussions initiated prompt actions pursued resulting positive feedback received appreciated sincerely thanks everyone present participatory actively supporting endeavor successful project accomplished shared joyful celebration hosted joint occasion honoring accomplishment significant milestone reached collectively celebrated mutual success enjoyed genuine pride acknowledging efforts expended diligently laboriously worked countless hours spent dedications unwavering resolve demonstrated commitment towards common goal achieving exceptional outcome recognized merits commemorated achievement worthy applause extended heartfelt gratitude expressed appreciatively thankfully wholeheartedly congratulations bestowed gladness embrace festive revelry ensuing party thrown extravagant banquet held jubilantly enjoying delicious feast prepared meticulous attention detail care inviting company delighted surprise guests arrived",
