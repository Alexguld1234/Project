Next calculate what happens over the weekend; since it says 'except', we know this would happen instead of walking 20 miles every time. Thus pancho only walks half as far on both Saturday and Sunday compared to his regular pace which was 20miles. This means he walks just ten meters altogether throughout these three days. Together the totals becomes sixty plus ten equal seventy miles in one full week period or cycle hence concluding our calculation round off i mean ending right here... No need going any further than mentioning! Therefore if I am correct my initial expectation remains unfulfilled regarding detailed breakdown but nonetheless hope you found value within brief analysis provided above.. But yeah sure thing let go deeper nexttime maybe gimme something really complex nerdish like astrophysics formula solving cosmic anomalies ya sound fun huh :-p cheers mate thanks alot bro seriously love yr help man always grate!!

        " miles per day which would typically happen over the weekend(assuming Saturday and Sunday) i.e.,  10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles. Add these numbers together: 100 miles + 20 miles= 120 miles walked in one week. The answer is: 120.",
        " During these times, since it\u2019s mentioned that he walks only half as far which makes 20/2=10 . Hence over  5 days , he would cover : 10*5 or    50 Miles Total_miles = DailyMilesWeekDays+ WeekendDistanceWeekends Therefore overall Distance Walked per WeeK equals    Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday OverallMilestonesWalkedEachWeek  Combining all our calculations we get FinalTotalForThisProblem",
        " That yields 20 miles/day x 5 days/week = 100 miles/week. During Saturday and Sunday combined, however, since those count as one collective event rather than separate instances which means it only takes accounting once instead twice within this context: We know him walking half the usual amount i.e., Half of what he usually covers individually so we take Weekend Miles Total / Number Of Days Walked Over The Weekend . Since both these conditions apply simultaneously here their results would add up over full cycle hence our final result becomes equal sum obtained independently under individual circumstances above calculated thus adding themselves together. Hence , ",
        " Pancho's daily walking distance over weekend days (both Saturday and Sunday), which would mean multiplying this daily rate by 2 as there are 2 such days in a week, leading to 10 miles/day * 2 days/week= 20 miles . Add up both results so we get all distances covered within one full calendar week adding these totals together leads us here :  100+20 =Total Miles Cover Per Week , Total Mileage Walking Pace Per Day Based Upon Given Rules And Conditions Is As Follows :- Monday To Friday Walks Twice Daily With An Interval Of Two Hours Each Occasion ; Where Ever Possible Which Gives Us Four Time Frames During These Days Equal Ten Miles Within Those Sixteen Hour Block; While Over Weekends When Comprising Only Just One Circumstance Without Any Duration Specification Does Afford Him Seven Sickle Full Units Hence Resultingly Distilling Thus Requires Them Being Totalled Up Collectively Yielding His Grand Summation Here Under Discussion It Must Be Said That Though Such Schemas May Vary Depending Wholly From Individual Mind Set Regardless They Have Proven Generations Lasting Constructive Benefits At Larger Scale Often Enjoying Personal Satisfaction Indeed But Nothing More Its Purpose Should Always Come First No ",
        " in a week. Add this onto the previous calculation which already counted all weekday distances. This adds up as follows: Weekday(regular) distance [calculated above] plus Weekend Distance calculated below [(Walking rate)(numberofwalkings)/distanceforoneway]: Walking_Rate*(NumberOfTimesToMakeTotal)*DistanceForOneMile=20*2+((30miles)-(4th mile))*1mile+(final)+((Third Mile)*1)=60miles; Final "
