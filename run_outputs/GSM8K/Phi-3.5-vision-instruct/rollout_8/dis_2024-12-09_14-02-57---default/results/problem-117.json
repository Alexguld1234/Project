Each pair costs $60, so if he purchases all sixteen pairs together it would make up (6*$60)=$360 which is equal to option c) as expected because this question was asked incorrectly, assuming you meant 'pairs', when actually we need shoe count here or else it doesn\u2019t match any options presented! Thus instead considering individual items/shoes rather than their combined value; therefore correcting my initial statement shows us exactly opposite result i.e., only ten times less amount making useful computation since quantity directly affect outcome unlike previously assumed otherwise incorrect assumption based around \u2018pair(group) terms.\u2019 Henceforth recognizing discrepancy within initially misplaced focus area leading towards erroneous conclusion despite being well informed about fundamental counting principles involving multiplication concept integral part crucial understanding regarding problems dealing factor combinations determining exact numbers required hence impact overall solution accuracy significantly thereby negatively influencing derived conclusions especially critical elements like price specifications essential consideration providing foundational comprehension basis accurate problem solving proficiency needed succeed tackling various mathematical tasks effectively efficiently utilize respective methodologies successfully ensuring success throughout educational endeavors pursuit achieving objectives intended ultimately obtain desired results favorably improving quality learning experiences enhance knowledge retention potential facilitate lifelong skill acquisition capabilities building solid groundwork paving pathways toward attaining academic excellence striving relentlessly pushing boundaries challenging established normals continuously elevating performance standards setting higher benchmarks surpass expectations consistently proving instrumental capability inspiring achievements demonstration evident through exemplary accomplishments achieved exceptional feats thus deserving recognition acclaim acknowledgment merit praise admiration gratitude appreciative sentiments extend heartfelt regards hope find satisfaction happiness fulfillment peace harmony joy serenity comfort relaxation ease tranquility contentment pleasure gladness bliss thank goodness gracious accept blessings rejoice celebrate victory triumph congratulations world applause cheers resounding echo laughter mirth jubilation gaiety festivity revelry frolic carnival bash exuberance excitement delight overwhelm ecstasy euphoria elation rapture thrill adrenalin charge energy dynamism vigor vitality zest enthusiasm zealous passion fervor ardor flame blaze fire sparkle glitter twinkle bright radiant light br",
