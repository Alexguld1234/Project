To cover its losses through the insurance policy premium (P), we know P equals 10 percent(or divided into ten equal parts) times price($). Hence   p=0.1*Price or Price=(p/0.1)=10xWhere x is dollar amount , so if p was equivalently calculated as one part out of fourteen ($14):then Price would come equivalednto:$14*.1=$**1.40 per centimeannum***as shown below:-material& construction costs together are **price=.1300$$so this means when making calculations using timeframeone year---insuringcostwillbepricematerial+jewellership+consuptiontotal(.1)*Totalpriceforentirebrochewehaveairedtherefore------insurancingcostperyear==$.1300*.1=$***130 praneyear**insteadofjusttenpercentoffthetotalcostwhichwouldtotallyalongestwo hundredthousandfiftiendollarsthatisexpensivesinceitdoesntreflecttheactualtimevalueofthepropertyinquestionwhenvaluingagricultureassetsyoumustmake use offourthree factors--physicalattributessuchasquantityqualityconditionlocationagealsoknownasrealizationriskprobabilityfromthatfactorwhethersusceptibletoresimployeroblanketeeringmotherdiseasehysteriaeconomicsysteminflationrecenttrendsamoreparticularmorefrequencywithrespecttolossexceedancyratehighertaxeslowmarketgrowenthishavegreatereffectonfinanceceilingatnorthpointincurrenctextractreplacementcoinvestmentinterruptionprofitsretrainingsupplementalschedulesdepreciationsaleslossseveryfactorsoughttomakeaclearcutictotraditionsuccessfulprofitmakingenterprisewhatiftheresectionsdon\u2019tapplicablehowcantheybettermeanyouknowthesamplesaintimeseachchapterincludespastpresentnearfuturecomparisonsdescriptionscaseexamplehistoryreviewnewdevelopmentsimplecalculatedmethodsadvantagesdisappportentsavingsbenefittosuchintangiblescannotputintonumbers",

        " fee)=$1300.$ To calculate ten percent of this figure add \".toFixed(2)\" which would keep only two decimals places ($1300*10/100=$130). Add these three amounts together ((500+800)+130=1430.). Therefore, the expression above can simplify to return just \"$1430.\" As we don\u2019t need extra formatting instructions here like $.toFixed(), simply stating \u201cAmy spent \u20b91430\u201d answers your question correctly without adding unnecessary zeros or non numerical characters such as '$'. Thus simplifying our initial calculation into cleanly formatted Indian Rupees amount .In other words,\u201dthe resultant value being asked for was \u2018currency', so removing any currency representation indicators present initially becomes mandatory\u201d.So again correcting my previous statement I suggest you use 'B:' instead considering proper language flow.. And keeping everything else intact .. Here goes ,Correct "
