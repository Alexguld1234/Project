        " invested another $50,000 into repair work. Therefore, before calculating profits, we need to calculate what this would increase the property\u2019s worth to (the original price plus half as much again). That means it raised its market value above ($80,000+$50,000) which equals $130,000 \u00d7 150% or $195,000(total new amount). To find out the actual gain/profit made if sold minus all costs involved; so take off purchasing prices & spendings \u2013 ((cost+repair)/new market cap)=((($80,000)+($50,000))-$195,000= $-65,000/-$200,000*100=(%). From here you can determine your gross return rate but keep in mind expenses such as taxes, interest etc... When taken completely apart however without these additional factors\u2026one finds themselves owning nothing better than just enough time spent away waiting around until future opportunity knocks! Based upon common sense alone not requiring statistical analysis nor researching past records one could easily conclude any financial endeavor holds potential risk despite possibly seemingly favorable returns especially when considering real life circumstances vs theoretical calculations often found within academic textbooks written primarily using blackboards rather classroom lectures due limited contextual applications pertaining specifically towards personal investments particularly those involving significant capital commitments required initially prior making choices concerning assets like houses versus mere speculation activities entail higher degree complexity thus impact results differently depending solely reliance mainly mathematical procedures only calculated once computed result yields no longer remains applicable regardless changes experienced over long periods under varying conditions otherwise known variables associated directly measuring performance across multiple scenarios cannot apply conclusively unless explicitly defined assumptions utilized throughout entire process being consistent unwavering specifications essential maintaining continuity integrity ensuring accuracy achievement aim precisely sought desiring avoid errors occurrences unexpected complications disrupt intended outcome impeding successful completion objective achieve goals set forth pursue overall success obtain desired state fulfill purpose established earlier undertaking tasks challenge overcome obstacles facing individual personally responsible accomplish feats individually recognized widely acknowledge contribute greater positive effects society collective benefit thereby strengthen economy bolster community solidarity build trust amongst stakeholders create sustainable environment promote inclusivity nurture healthy relationships enhance communication skills foster cooperation improve team",
        " the overall investment into the property becomes 80,000 (initial price) plus 50,000 (repair expenses), which adds up to 130,000 dollars spent so far. When these repair jobs complete, it boosts the worthiness of this home by around one hundred percent or 100% extra than its original purchase pricing tag. Essentially increasing the entire marketable valuedness beyond halfway past allotted funds i.e., ($130,000)*(1+1/2)=($130,000*3/2). Following arithmetical calculation we get equal result as 195,000 $. Hence if selling would occur currently such circumstances exist; meaning every cent above what was initially paid can count toward making outright profits upon resale deals hence yielding net gains once everything settles down again subsequently equalling sales revenue exceeding summed financial contributions put forward during renovation work process thereby achieving positive fiscal returns post operation cycle execution period concluding operations successfully bringing balance sheet positively towards bottom line earning statements reflective values displayed across official company annual report archived documents provided under regulatory compliance governing business transactions ensuring transparency while also protecting shareholder rights promoting ethical standards among management team directors executives officers personnel etc. To determine actual profit obtained through sale proceedings subtract aggregate costs associated throughout restoration project timeline intervals considering both capital appreciations achieved due historical growth rates over time against present fair prices prevailing within current real estate markets setting specific benchmark indices serving public interest guidance purposes alignments required according laws applicable locally elsewhere worldwide globally harmonized measurement practices facilitating cross border comparisons further bolster economic stability & development accelerated mutual benefits leading shared prosperity fostering community cohesion building stronger social bonds enhancing collective understanding empower individuals striving success together unlock potential future opportunities generating sustainable impact contributing inclusiveness uplifting marginalised groups transformative progress paving way global peace dividends creating better tomorrow bridging divides uniting hearts minds nurturing hope humanizing touch elevating spirits celebrating life experiences reminiscent joyful moments cherished memories immortal legacy embraced love family friends relatives neighbours coworkers colleagues acquaintances strangers passerbys pedestrians street",

By adding 150% increase due to renovations (which means multiplying it by 1.5), you get what\u2019s new price as such; ($130,000)*(1.5) =>$ 195,000. Therefore, when subtracting costs initially spent into these figures, Josh makes a profit equal to : $195,000-$130,000=$65,000 this case therefore making him gain around six hundred and fifty thousand dollar net worth overall within time span mentioned herein above. Thus conclusion drawn may aptly conclude thus;\"So indeed,\" quoth I unto myself rather bemused if truthfully candidate would venture claim unjust so slight without justifiable grounds.\" Consideration granted towards all parties henceforth remains integral factor during proceedings ahead.\u201d!",
        ", we need first calculate what 150% increase means. It\u2019s equivalent to multiplying it by 2.5 (because you add another hundred percent). Thus, the new valuation would equal 2.5*$130,000= $325,000. But if everything ended up like that outright, he wouldn't gain anything because even though he paid extra amount but same time when selling , also gets back bigger revenue . Therefore since its not possible let him sell home without making any loss just due change in price alone & assuming every one else didn&apost buy those houses only than here comes rule(total purchase lesser sale) so applying formula : Total Purchase Amount Less Sale Price Will Give Profit Here Repair expenses already took place hence excluding them while calculating sales price as well all together Final calculations go as follow ;  Original House Cost :$80k   Additional Expenditure Due To Renting Houses :+$50K    Equals : ($80+50)*1.5=$195K Let us find profits As per Rule Given Lets Take Actual Value Sold Of That Property i..e:$325k-$195 kTotal Gain Is Goal ",
        " To calculate percentage increase means multiplying by (percentage/100). Therefore: ((150*80)/100)=$120,000 additional worth due to improvements made but not yet sold or refunded because it\u2019s still unprofitable until sale. Adding all these together represents the new property estimate post-improvements($130,000+$120,000=$<<(150*80)+(80+50)*(100/100)=250000>>250,000), implying if he sells it as such without expenses like closing fees etc., hence, making him profitable only when subtracting investment amount from current market valuation i.e.$250,000-$130,000=>>$120,000 Profit.

        " $80,000*150/100= $120,000 increase due to renovations alone. Adding these values together shows us the sale price of the home; $130,000(the combined investment amount)+$120,000($increase)= $250,000(). Finally subtracting our starting amount, we see our net gain as follows: $.",
        " add back the actual expense of $50,000, getting us $120,000 + $50,000 = $170,000 worth when considering both purchase price and improvement. Finally, subtracting our investment summed up across these actions $(80,000 + 50,000)$ results in him having made no profits because he broke even without any overage; so if you consider it only regarding revenue generated compared to spending \u2013 not just gain or loss \u2014 then theoretically such project cannot yield net positive income but instead lead directly into equalized exchange rate post full restoration. It seems I might misunderstand your request slightly based on provided prompt information leading towards possible ambiguity surrounding 'profit calculation'.
