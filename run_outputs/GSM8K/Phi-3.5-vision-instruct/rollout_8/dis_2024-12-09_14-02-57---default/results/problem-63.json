This means Aleena gets back fifteen cents ($0.15) off every dollar spent (since twenty percent reduction implies forty pennies or fourteen minus one penny deduction).

Multiplying this new chargeable fee by another three months equals: $95/month * 3= $285   . Finally adding both sums up to find out what was finally spent over all twelve cumulative payments results into: $840+ $285=$1,125 which makes it clear that overall, Alexa ended up saving quite a bit.

        " these six months, Aleena was being billed $140/month without any discount which equals $(140*6) or $840. Condition 2 says that during the remaining 6 months, a decreased rate applies \u2013 this indicates that those rates became only 90%, so instead of paying full price ($140), she pays just ((90 percent of it)) i.e., .9*$140=$126 every single month but still times 6 because condition states 'for all next six months'. Therefore multiplying gets us a value of $(126*6)=$756 saved due to reduced billing over latter part of year as compared to no reduction scenario if everything remained unchanged throughout whole entirety of the said calendar period considered hereinabove described upon mentioned conditions fulfillment. Finally adding both amounts together provides calculated overall expense related matter discussed thus far summarized upfront before proceeding onto answering sought question about specified case inquiry hence provided below directly responding back accordingly:-Final Sum Total Money Paid By End Of Year=First Part Bill Amount+ Second Portion Adjusted Deduction From Initial Billed RatePer Month Period Expenses Equals Given Formula Result Expression Yield Computation Outcome Calculated Thus Completed As Per Stipulated Information Clincher ",

        " next six months, instead of paying full price, she gets a discount equivalent to 10%. To compute this discount, multiply $140 times ten percent or ($140 * 10/100) so it equals to $14 as decrement in cost every single month. Therefore, during these six subsequent months, she only spends $(140-14)=$126x=756$. Hence adding both totals together means,$Total Amount Paid=$($840+$756)$=$**1596$$ Given "
