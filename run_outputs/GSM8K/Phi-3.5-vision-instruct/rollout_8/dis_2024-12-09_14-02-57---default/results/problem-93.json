This equation simplifies into approximately equals thirty three minutes plus fifty six hundredths sec=(rounding off upwards because you cannot measure partial milliseconds)(or slightly under forty eight seconds).. Or another way around this problem might look like this... Let X represent our variable 'Gerald running'. We know without knowing anymore information whatsoever that Gerald currently takes double as long as Lee taking twice nineteen points sixty.(We assume here half the difference divided over themselves gets us either nearest possible value since actual differences may vary minute but still remain within these bounds.)

Here, Rate Percent(%) equals reduction percentage i.e., 10; Initial Value stands as running time before improvement=40 seconds -> IV=40 sec. Substituting these values into our calculation yields decrease amount = IV*RP/100 => Decrease Amount=40*(10)/100=>DecreaseAmount=4seconds.(He was saving four secs). Therefore subtract this saved duration form gerald\u2019s previous best timing --> New Best Timestamp=(OldBestTimestamp)-DifferenceInTimeRequiredForSpeedImprovementGeraldnewbesttime=40sec-(4secs)= 36Secondso finally since question asks us \u2018how fast .....with......improved .........can ...run ,\u2019 hence We put ",

At least not until I get farther along my solution. When someone improves their performance or something increases X% better, all such problems require one simple formula first before doing anything else . That initial formula tells us precisely what happened when these changes took place , i.e. :   New_Result=Old_Result(base)+Change=.

As another way to get our expression into one term, I realize my previous solution was incorrect! My apologies\u2026So let me correct myself...To make things easier when dealing percentages like these, express whatever you want % wise either as decimal points OR whole numbers (depending on what makes your head hurt less). Just keep track throughout every equation using parentheses around all operations occurring within them\u2014for instance:\"L = (Gx1.05)\" tells us clearly 'Multiply both sides first times ten hundred fifty over fifteen.' Okay back to work here!...Ok again..so if someone asked \u201cHow long would Fred take doing something twice compared against Edna who takes half?\u201d Our logic gets complicated right away since no matter whether X equals three minutes (Fred; Twice); Ten Seconds ((Edna Half Time)). Simply double everything else involved except itself doesn\u2019t quite cut across because even though doubling once doubles anything twice keeps proportionate equality intact during multiplication processes themselves.( FD^2 / EH = ED ^T ).
