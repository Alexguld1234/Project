        " 2 = 18 dollars. The answer is: 18.",
        " would be 2 x $8 which equals $16. Since Jimmy has $2 more, we add those extra two dollars making it $16 + $2 equaling $18. Therefore, Jimmy has $18 or as stated before : \"$18.\"",
        " 16. Two dollars more than this amount would mean adding 2 so finally it totals up as 16+2=18. Hence Jimy has $18. The answer is: 18.",
        " more so it would add up as 16 + 2 which equals to 18. Therefore, if Ethel has $8, therefore according to what was said above; Jimmy has $18 (since 'twice plus another dollar'). Thus you could say this sentence below..Accordingly, based on your query mentioned earlier here, we can deduce that Jim(p) currently possesses approximately doubled or close around four times lesser compared to Eunji(n); hence translating numerically into p=j/e\u2248m*(r^k), substituting known values results p=j/e\u2248m*((n)^(-a)) .
