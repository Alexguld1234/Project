To find out what happened during the remainder of the week we consider only one night since it was stated 'rest of the week.' We know this particular time period includes Thursday which would fall into \u2018remainder\u2019 category so let us use the result as basis i.e., sadie went back up by 1 additional hour compared to previous consecutive sleeping times. Therefore, Sadie slept ((6+1)*2)=14 extra hours across these remaining coupled slots ('Thursday' being mentioned twice thus counted once). Adding all together results in (8 [Monday] +  6[Tuesday]+6[Wednesday])+(14[Extra Week Remaining Sleep]). All combined makes : 34 Hours throughout the entirety of last fortnight (two weeks ago!).

Therefore, during the entire week, Sadie managed only about 27 percent of normal adult recommended daily amount of average healthy zzz's.

        "/night = 6 hours per night for Tuesday and Wednesday (which makes it over all three; so this would add up as though you calculated one six hour span). Next calculate how long Sadie slept during Thursdays and Fridays since we know these periods account for half the remaining weeks excluding Sunday when calculating average times based off Saturday averages alone . During both sessions combined , Saddie spent about eight plus fourteen or twentytwo minutes awake out right before going into bed but without falling directly back onto your pillow if using meditation techniques like counting sheep etc .. It took around ten seconds /second while lying down trying desperately not fall completely soundly unconscious upon waking again..

        " 2 nights = 12 hours. Determine the increased sleep duration during other days (from Tuesday to Thursday). As mentioned earlier it would increase by 1 hour; therefore, sadie needs to get 6+1=7 hours every new nighttime period starting Wednesday until Friday. Thus find out the totals summing up all four times periods into one value using arithmetic operations correctly this way : Money_spent=(NumberOfMouthRubbers*CostPerRubble)+(ExtraBurryForCuteChildren*(StandardPrice)/2)So if we plugged our values back here like so:(5)*(4)=($20)+((1)(4/2))This reduces down as follows:$20+(1\\times2)$$20+$2=$22"
