Times this value multiplied against quantities purchased results in ($2)*(9) or $18 revenu made off of petunium purchases. Begonia costs come out being about $.12 short of doubling their price when rounded up, therefore bringing them down to zero income; but since Artie wants extra coinage coming through those transactions we can assume customers agreed upon payments beforehand due diligence. As such...begonia returns $0 despite increased demand!
