To calculate the average consumption among these six people divided evenly you divide this result equally i.e., Total/Number_of_people => Mean(Average). This becomes mean(fruit_rollups)=Total/number_ofPeople=>Mean=[90]/[6]=(mean(average))=15.(Following our guidelines only one meaningful solution per question required hence no extra calculations.) .

Thus, when you calculate 90 divided by 2, your resultant value comes out to 45 roll-ups per person i.e., four and half tens digits imply forty followed by one digit thus arriving approximately sixty being rounded off into nearest ten units making our output six.

        " each row is three roll-ups wide, so he ate 14 * 3 = 42 roll-ups. Together they ate 48+42= 90 roll-ups altogether. They averaged this across one another since it\u2019s per person question which means we need divide evenly. We thus take our result (ie.,  90) divided by Number of people involved(which here amounts to two). Therefore ,On average when all things considered, taking into account errors committed along the way during the initial stages; these calculations indicate about halfway through \u2013 i.e approximately .

        " 3 = 42 roll-ups. Together, they ate 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups. To find the average per person, we divide this sum by the number of people which is 2 (since it only involves Marcell or Beatrice). Therefore, they consumed an average of 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45 roll-ups each. However, since these averages apply individually not together, when talking about them jointly you would still refer back on individual totals i.e., Marcell had around 42 roll-ups and Beatrice approximately 48 making a combined estimate roughly equaling approx. 90. But strictly speaking in terms of 'average', it indicates ~45 roll-ups consumption per one out of Marcell & Beatrice during respective instances. As such without further context needed I conclude saying :They ate almost half ('around') same quantity('approx.' meaning near) but exact count differs if considering separately vs collectively.)

        " together Mashell and Bonnie ate all but one column (a total of n-1), meaning we subtract it once before counting them individually; if only m/n people counted this way then ((M+B)/m)*((N-1)/(n-1))*C would count these numbers correctly when N != m.
