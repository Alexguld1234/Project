Delivery fees amount up to twenty percent (20%) pertaining to checkout means adding onto this summing everything before the extra charge i.e., addition operation namely :   $(sub prices )+(chips)+(cookies)=($15+$3+$1=$19). With respect to checking our calculations let us multiply them as stated above or employ calculators if required.. Thus deliveryn_cost=%d*order=($19*$0.20/$0.20)*order. To determine your estimate regarding shipping expenses; use round numbers nearest zero digits suchlike multiples/integers alongwith approximate values nearest thousandth digit so ruling down towards lesser value options rather than increasing figures since approximation works well when dealing only slightly off decimal points but not exact amounts like centavo changes may cause discrepancies thus preventing accurate estimation based solely upon intuition without proper guidance provided throughout calculation processes involved hereunder while also avoiding double counting similar quantities unless specified otherwise during initial setup henceforth clarifying any potential ambiguity created due lackadaisical approach toward precise understanding behind numerical evaluations made involving summation methods apart being merely rounded estimates themselves irrespective whichever mode employed whether using algebraic expressions algebraic terms within mathematical formulae present already listed beside equations contained inside parenthesis indicating further details concerning said problem statement explicitly mentioning relevant variables included alongside specific operations conducted against same mentioned elements priorhand thereby generating correct output results obtainable via straightforward computation steps encompassed therefore allowing reader comprehend entire process clearly despite occasional misunderstandings arising occasionally owing confusion caused possibly stemming indirect errors committed previously causing misalignments occurrences commonly found happening routinely among beginners attempting solving problems manually yet still managing small mistakes even though applying appropriate techniques learned online whilst studying related topics earlier elsewhere besides practice exercises completed diligently over numerous sessions until attaining desired level competency necessary completing those assigned tasks accurately accordingly ensuring full satisfaction obtained through knowledge gained subsequently applied successfully utilizing acquired abilities whenever called forth usefulness demonstrated skill",
        " chips come up to 2 * $1.50 = $3.00. Next calculate the cost of the cookies. Two cookie costs 2*$1= $2. Add all these items together before taxes or tips so this equals  15+3+2=$20. As per problem setup we need to incorporate 20 % delivery fees which would equal .2*20=$4 Total subtotal including everything else plus shipping comes as follows : (subtotal) +(delivery) +tip amount due/payable=. That amounts here ($20+$4)+($5)=$29",
        " of the cookies. She gets 2 cookies at $1.00 apiece; therefore these items cost 2*$1.00=$2.00. Therefore before tax or tips, your meal costs altogether come up as follows:$15+$3+$2=$20 Total sales including discount comes to:(($20)*.8)+($20)=$36 (the .8 represents removing the entirety of fees being charged). Adding Tip,$36+tip=$41 ($41 includes base price plus additional charges.) ",
        " Two bags of chips at $1.50 each would cost 2 * 1.50 = $3.00. And two cookies at $1.00 each would cost 2 * 1 = $2. Adding these amounts up before fees comes to a subtotal of 15 + 3 + 2= $20. The items amount totals to $20 so if we increase this sum by (20/100)*(2+5) because it includes both food & service charge as well , i get $$$20*(1+(20/100))=\\$$$(1 extra dollar per dollar spent), therefore adding everything together gives me $$\\$(20*1)+(\\\\)$$\\(5)=\\\\$25$. ",
        " each, so this amounts to 2 * 1.50 = $3.00. And she gets 2 cookies priced at $1.00 each, making it another 2 * 1.00= $2.00. Summing up these prices results into a subtotal price without tax or tips equaling 15+3+2=$20.00  ",
        " adds another 2 items (cookies) priced at $1.00 each so it totals up as well; i.e., she spends 2*1 = $2.00 or just $2. Added together these three amounts comes down to $15.00+$3.00+$2.00= $20. That means without additional fees & tips etc.. , this came up to only ($20). However since we need all those things taken into account such as the addition of a service charge(delivery )and Tip here's what I calculated:- Delivery charges would work out like if you multiply .2 times our original amount before any other charges ie.(total sub/chip prices): (.2)*($20)=$4,-so let us say your base price wass around $x.$Now when tax and everything else gets charged onto said value:$x=(.)baseprice+(.2*)(subprices)+tip-$where $(.).^a dot ^b represents vector multiplication.-So substituting above values:(.)$&nbsp;&nbsp;<|end_of_document|&nbsp;&nbsp;(=.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<|start_of_textbox|>&nbsp;&nbsp;$.(&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtract $-,$that leaves me with($(.).$(dot)-($)).$-Then substitute actual numbers again but this time including my deductions about the extra features mentioned:->**[(].[$] [(].[]).-([])]**-> **[($15 + $3 + $2)[*.2]+$5]]=$((20 [.*]%.2) $[+) $.****Because percentages can always act differently depending upon factors associated eg. location area wise, region wise... But based on data provided above .. one may take away conclusion being ::: This whole thing turned out approximately $25.<|end_of_solution|><|end_of_question|>",
        " 2 * 1.00 = $2.00. Adding all these together gets us (15+3+2) =$20.00 so far without any additional charges or tips yet. Since it was mentioned before the price needs to include both service and ingredients, we need to multiply this amount ($20.00)*(1+20%) because the charge includes everything except the optional tip included later as well. That calculation would result into; $20* 1.2= $24. Subsequently, when you want to increase your spending budget per occasion since services can fluctuate over time based off inflation rates/demand etc., adding further amounts like those extra purchases may lead one eventually getting closer toward their maximum expenditure point during purchase occasions such instances require judicious oversight .
