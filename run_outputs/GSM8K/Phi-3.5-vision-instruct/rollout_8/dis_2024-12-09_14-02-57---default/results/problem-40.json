Also knowing from this question that Brandon's mobile device aged was thrice compared to Ben's one , so finally means brandon's smartphone ages  2*4=x or simply put (ben_age)*(brandon_ratio) => x=(1year)(4)=4 Year Old.

        " phone is twice Betsy's phone (Ben=Betsy*2), so it makes him 1*2 years or 2 years old. Compute for Benjamin's brother Phone Age; His brother's telephone equipment being said to be quadrupled relative to what Ben owns signifies making his gear aged 2 * 4 or double that amount. Therefore, this suggests your younger sibling possesses an apparatus aged sixteen years.
