        " discount as a new customer, multiply the original price ($100) by 0.3 (which represents 30%). This results in a discount value of $30. Subtract this discount amount from the initial cost to find out what it actually amounts to; i.e., subtract $30 from $100 so we get $70. Therefore, due to the offered promotional deal upon becoming their first client, John only needs to pay $70 rather than the usual chargeable fee of $100. Thus, before any additional charges or taxes associated may apply following local regulations governing pet services, the base expense borne directly because of utilizing said specialized offer would account upward totalling about seventy US Dollars exactly ('$70').
