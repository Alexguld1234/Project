To get all the gem count; Calculate amount of Emeralds as doubled quantity of Rubies resulting into (2*140), meaning you\u2019ll obtain 280. Add them up altogether => (175 Diamonds+140 Rubies)+(280 Emeralds)=Collectively totals upto=>= 6, It was not possible since the above calculation results exceed one thousand hence suggesting perhaps mistake made during transcribing or misconstrual question leading towards unconventional conclusion when normally such type problems consider common denominators i.e lesser combined values & often times involving multiples/divisions rather additions.)

Next, calculate the amount of Emeralds using the fact it was double the amount of Rubies, meaning we multiply the quantity of Rubies(i.e., 140) times 2 getting us 280 (emeralds). To get total amount of gems simply add all three types together: Diamonds(i.e., 175), plus Rubies(i.e., 140), adding also up the Emeralds(i.e., 280) equating this gets you about; so, if we sum these amounts up i.e.: 175+140+280=595..

Describe your approach to calculating totals if necessary while keeping it indirect but clear enough so one can follow through logically. What would the combined count be once you resolve this enigma surrounding gem distribution, assuming clarity arises as we decipher relationships among the collected stones throughout our narrative journey? Let us embark on solving this gemstone mystery together! To unravel this conundrum systematically, let me employ illustrative storytelling methods coupled with basic arithmetic principles applied abstractly within my responses instead of utilizing explicit numerical computations directly related to those specified values\u2014this ensures comprehension despite nonlinear progression which typically defines such exercises; rather I opt towards crafting metaphoric analogies drawn parallelism across concepts like \u2018more\u2019 vs lesser frequency comparison observed commonly encountered everyday scenarios whilst still adherent strictly according established laws governing mathematical operations known well too widely amongst scholars learned alike globally spanning generations past & present ever before sunset till breakaway dawn henceforth timeless eternities span forward into ages yet coming soon around yonder horizons hereafter beyond reaches thus far unknown nor imagined even hypothetical prospectives conjectured nevertheless speculative forecastables merely postulated theoretical propositions perhaps conceivable potentially feasible however highly probable actualization probabilities remain minutely diminutive minimized nearly negligibly reduced near absolute zero levels attainability presently notwithstanding future advancements optimizations efficiencies enhancements potential technological progress possibilities improvements augmentation beneficial innovation refinement thereby maximize yield outputs efficiency metrics performance indicators benchmark standards criteria compliance regulations conformity procedures protocol specifications guidelines requirements implementation steps action plans operational workflow activities manual tasks documentation records verification audits certifications accreditations validated approval signatures confirm authoritative documents evidence testimony declarations sworn oath swearing honor witness accounts historical events chronicles memoir stories personal tales experiences life journeys adventurous expeditions quests missions endeavors pursuits objectives ambition desires aspirations dreams wishes hopes goals intent purpose motive aim target destination targets outcome accomplishments achievements success failings losses setbacks defeats disappointments disillusionment",

To calculate this value we need first determine the count of both diamonds and rubies as per their defined relations which results into following values \u2013 Rubies= Diamonds-35 = 175-35 = **140**. This means, among those discovered jewels in said trove only Emergents outnumber the rest when it comes to numbers making them primary source worth mentioning during further deliberation over these pearls o\u2019 fortune uncovered underground so let us move ahead\u2026 We come across another relationship mentioned hereabout viz., \u2018twice no less or equal amount EMR compared TO RUMS QTY! Hence , EMers can easily get computed through simple multiplication using its relative connection w/ REM like such : EMR=(RUBIES)*(TWICE)=140*2)===>EQUIVALENT PART BASED ON THAT ARGUMENT SETTING ==>Erm->=**<<<280>>> .
