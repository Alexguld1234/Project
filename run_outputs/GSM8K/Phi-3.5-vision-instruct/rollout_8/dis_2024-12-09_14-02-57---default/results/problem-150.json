We need this value rounded up since one cannot wait less than even fractions of minutes(in terms such problems). Hence rounding we get TIME STEVE\u2248 35 mins or 35m min+ sec if you divide leftover decimal into seconds because Time equals distance divided by rate..So when steve completes journey,tim takes longer so tim spends those extra few secs reaching back while stoepwatching....Tim rides 2 mile (equal to  10560 ft.)at speeds spped of 264ft./sec., hence taking around :TIM REASONABLE BREAKTIME = Distance/Speed=> Time_for_time = 10560 ft / (264 fpm)= approx~ 40 mins ,which translates to ~ 40 mins . Since timer spent more amount ti time watching insteadof racing ,he needs fewer milliseconds during these additional times.He reaches about halfway point fasterbecause only part od trail still exists forhim...so subtract remaining milestone distances:(remaining meters-(average metersto complete))*speed=(half way)*timer average racingspeed=.

Since both cannot reach their homes at exactly the same moment due to different speeds, we subtract Steven\u2019s traveling time from Timothy\u2019s. This means that around this difference which equals around ~5 min., Steven would wait while Tim reaches first because tim took longer duration compared steve.. Therefore, the answer choice closest without going under or higher than actual value seems most accurate here as round off numbers often occur during estimates.- Consider converting your distances into meters too!

As we round this off since these times reflect discrete units rather than continuous ones, this equates to around 44 minutes. For Tim: His journey lasts about 2*5280/264=40minutes because he needs less time due to both being closer and moving faster. To find out if there\u2019s any wait time one might observe once arriving back; compare the finishing times \u2013 This means either Steve wins implying no delay while coming home since Mike gets here first even though slows down earlier ,or vice versa\u2013 meaning Steve won but took longer overall including return trip thus causing delays . Here comes our most crucial figure into play! It stands at Steves arrival minus Timmies leaving hours upon completion indicating differences over those exact moments making difference zero(no change) signifying equal distances reached despite speed discrepancies owning different start points yet hitting target simultaneously marking tie victory insteadof individual winning accrual like typical normative competition rules dictate hence revealing intriguing unique aspects underlying ordinary circumstances challenging preconceived notions often associated with straightforward comparisons involving relative velocities amongst participants vying towards identical terminus post concurrently regardless varying parameters influencing outcome determinations thereby establishing foundational understanding based unorthodox methodology facilitating comprehension beyond superficial surface observations frequently encountered throughout mundane life routine scenarios alike numerous other facets contributing similarly fundamental insights pertinent everyday reasoning skills cultivated consistently necessitated amidst myriads otherwise complex matters demand careful ponderings evoking profound interpretive acumen potentially stimulating intellectually enriching discussions fostering collectively shared consciousness amalgamating diverse perspectives ultimately achieving symbiotic balance sustaining cohesive societal progress forwardward propelling humanity advancing interrelated civilisations worldwide whilst maintain constant vigilance preserving equilibrium within global order promoting perpetual peaceful coexistence among earthlings aspiring harmonious mutual respect uphold ethical ideals universal values treasuring inherent dignity honoring indivisible rights safeguarding sanctity spiritual principles advocacy egalitarianism inclusivity tolerance justice equality freedom liberty fraternity brotherhood solidarity charity love kindness mercy compassion humility",
        " With a speed of 264 feet per minute, it would take him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes. Since Steve took longer, we need to find out how much sooner Tim arrives. Subtracting timings: 43.636 \u2013 40 = 3.636 minutes. Thus, if both arrived simultaneously when walking together instead, Stevie gets to wait about 3.636 mins as Tyler finished first while biking towards Home.
