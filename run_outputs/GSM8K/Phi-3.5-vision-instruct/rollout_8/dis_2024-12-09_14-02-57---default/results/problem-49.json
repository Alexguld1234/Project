Since half (or three quarters) of these buildings is already occupied; we get as our first stop just subtract one quarter out because this leaves us exactly half full which equals 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 units still available since only one third or four fifths remain vacant according to your question but considering it being 'one fourth', not occupancy percentage'. Therefore if initially all was openly accessible i.e., fully utilized before any changes occurred within those bounds, Richard\u2019s remaining unoccupied spots can count up to precisely thirty empty rooms awaiting potential tenants.

Given that only three quarters (or 75%) of these are filled; this implies that one quarter or exactly half (since we consider full numbers) remains empty as it cannot exceed whole persons).

To get the amount not being used or unused you subtract this result from your original totals. Unused   120 \u2013 90Unused      30To recap; We knew our starting value was 120 and divided them into groups using quarters because Richard wanted us to use fractions as instructed instead of decimals.(Or if converting decimal points work just remember .75 equals three parts over four equaling one whole part plus seven fifths.) This method worked very well but made things easier since I didn\u2019t know any specific math rules relating anything like \u201cthe difference\u201d etc..

Lastly since we subtract our result above form actual count , we get :  120-(90*2)=**30 units remain free & vacant*** This last equation comes into play because when you accounted for Richards existing occupancy within said premises during your initial calculation process ; hence why multiplying remainder quantity against another instance of itself (*denoting its duplication across both sides pertaining totality ) resulted upon us **twice as large numbers reflectiveof those previously derived values themselves !!!

        " building is 15*8= 120 units. Since 3/4 of the buildings are full houses or offices this means only one fourth remains empty hence (1 /4)x120 = 30 which indicates 30 remain as vacant apartments. Thus,  30 residents stay outside Richard\u2019s neighbourhood while the other half take advantage living inside it resulting into him sharing space within the premises despite its size but not being able get all alone like before because three quarters occupy nearly every corner including areas adjacent too! Hence we can say based off above logic statement; \u2018total_units_empty=[(total_unit)-floor]\u2018 Therefore putting actual numbers accordingly would turn out something similar saying\u2026 'So basically if X equal equals Z minus W...[answer here]=B.'

That way you calculate p%:(.((1*(Unfurnished+Empty))/(MaxOccupationPerUnit*maxFloorSpace)+NoChangeInDesireToLiveHere).

        " this means there are 15 * 8= <<15*8=120>>120 units in the entire building. Since only 1/4 (or 1 minus 3/4) remains as vacant or 'unoccupied', we multiply the number of overall units, which totals up to 120(total_units)*(1-(3/4))=(120*(1/(4))) => This equals to 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 units remaining unsold or not used. Hence, Richard's living area possesses about three scores and ten additional rooms available yet devoid of inhabitants presently if every unit houses one household or individual group.
