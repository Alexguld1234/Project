And since an orange costs 5 pounds less per unit price as compared to a watermelon ,it means every single fruit basket was worth  180 - 5 = <<180-5=175>>175$, which totals up to   175 dollar/fruit basket \u00d7 10 fruit baskets =  1750$. Therefore combined all together you get; Total Spending = Watermelons+Peppers+$Oranges$-Total Cost $$(180)+(300)$+(no need to add any value for 'orange')-$$$$(1750$) = $-240$.
