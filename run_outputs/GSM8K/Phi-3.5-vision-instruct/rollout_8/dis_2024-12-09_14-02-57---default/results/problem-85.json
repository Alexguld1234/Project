Since Gene takes 4 vacations per year, we multiply those 11 years by these 4 annual vacations resulting into 11*4=<<11*4=44>>44 individual unique blocks or rows. Because all rows use up entire separate sets of previous memories so as not to mix them together later during mending/repairs etc., hence no additional calculations necessary beyond what already happened previously while calculating holidays over time periods..

However, if we consider partial journeys or instances which might not provide complete sets but nonetheless countable resources towards making parts of a quilt patchwork piece -- these could potentially add up substantial numbers further than initial calculations suggest.
