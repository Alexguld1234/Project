Here multiple values start form lowest upwards until reach upper bound set ; since only integer value allowed let us scan these candidates till lower bounds meet target amount . As our case requires scanning possible multiples within limits i would use iterative method here instead because direct calculation seems pretty overcomplicated especially when dealing with large inputs ... hence implementing loop structure makes most sense ! To satisfy above conditions following condition needs fixing : Given input range `[low_bound <= n_range_val == high_bound]` if exists `i` satisfying `(x % k )=0 || no residue left)` such equation allows solving easily via simple formula namely division `$int((high_bound- low_bound)/k)$`.
