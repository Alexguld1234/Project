Therefore, divide 60 (second prediction only due to rounding error if needed otherwise could include initial or other estimates too). Hence, even when considering possible variance, individual differences aren't explicitly addressed nor directly considered within calculations thus limiting accuracy potential based solely on available info without assuming arbitrary adjustments beyond provided input data., hence producing no direct single figure representation but rather highlighting discrepancy relative against baseline calculation methods implied through contextual reference..

Finally, divide this sum of everyone's guesses by 3 because there are 3 people involved (since averages require divisors equal to numbers being averaged):  240/3=80 jelly bean per person or about 26.67 when rounded up if needed as most real situations don't deal with partial entities like part jellybeans).
