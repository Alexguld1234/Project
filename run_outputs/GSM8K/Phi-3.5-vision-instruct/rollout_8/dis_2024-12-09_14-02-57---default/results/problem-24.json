        " 25% equals 75%) of the original price, it means this can also written as :$19.50 = .75*P$. To solve for Price(P), divide both sides of equation by .75:$19.50/.75= $P$, or about $26. Therefore, the Original cost of Book Before Discount would have been around $26. The answer is: 26.",
        " 'P', you can use this calculation formula: P = ($19.50 / 75%) or dividing $19.50 by 0.75, resulting into approximately $26. Therefore, the original cost for the novel would\u2019ve been around $26. The answer is: 26.  ",
