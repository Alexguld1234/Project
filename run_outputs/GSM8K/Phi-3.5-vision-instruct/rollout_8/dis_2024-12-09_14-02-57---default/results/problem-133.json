Therefore calculating further reveals the missing daily data point i.e., Distance Travelled/walked on Wednesday can thus calculated via simple math operations using formula [(TotalThreeDayTrailing= TotalOfTwoDaysBeforeIt)+(AdditionalThirdDay)=ExpectedOutcome] , meaning [i.e. (WalkDistances_Mon+ Tue)=RemainingBalanceFromWholeValue]. By filling values within parameters or variables derived from actual numerical expression set out above results into equation formulation : Remaining Balance Value From Whole Equivalent would therefore equal[ i.e.(OriginalFourDollars)-[(AlreadyKnownTwosomeValSum)/1).
