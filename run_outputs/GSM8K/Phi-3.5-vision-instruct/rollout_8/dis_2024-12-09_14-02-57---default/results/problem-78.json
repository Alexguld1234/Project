His cost using this strategy becomes higher because every single flower purchased gets him one less opportunity to get three instead of just being forced into bundles making them too expensive overall compared opting for bundle sizes allowing you purchase individual items separately without sacrificing any quantity required whilst preserving as much value as possible within budget limitations based upon unit pricing strategies established herewith presented visibly clarifying discrepancy present across multiple methodologies discussed elsewhere thus causing confusion among consumers who might otherwise benefit greatly through employment such tactics according thereto described specifically due unto inherent logic flaws embedded wholly throughout entirety contained enclosed thereby including also consideration amongst stakeholders ranging widely inclusive but nevertheless explicitly comprised exclusively inside above listed parameters set forth uniformly yet differentiated subtly amidst various facets henceforth implying necessity existential requiring further analysis beyond mere numerical expression regarding quantities involved directly correlational connection ultimately essential nonetheless warrant immediate attention before commencing undertaking respective investigations necessary pursuant accordingly seeking resolution satisfying all parties concerned alike regardless however acknowledged presently await completion prior proceeding until conclusion reached satisfactory level agreeable finally culmination results producing conclusions derived solely emancipated independently determined internally independent entirely autonomously generated mindfully untainted liberated free formingly perfect naturally achieved effortlessly wholeheartedly optimistically confidently trustworthily positively convincing clearly comprehensible straightforward transparently simple understandably approach effectively efficiently quickly reliably predictably repeatedly consistently repeatably accurately flawlessly definitively absolutely correct necessarily always correctly obviously invariably unequivocally exactly surely certainly precisely indeed assured undoubtedly yes decidedly affirmatively hopefully successfully eventually happily ideally best perfectly totally foreverforevermorepermanentlyuntilfinallyunquestionablyeverfiniteso longthatnoneversomuchneedsmustneednodyetremebutimmediatelydoobviouslydefinitelynecessarilyatuallyalwaysrightcertainlateralreadyaftersomewhatanyhowthereforepreciselywhateversoeverywherenowherewhenbeforecurrentlocaltimeperiodsincepresentmomentstarting",

Therefore, Vincent ultimately saves $((0.33)*18)=$5.94$. This means if Vince opted instead to pay full price regardless of whether it was one pack of three blooms or one pack of six blossoms as opposed to getting those discount rates presented above; That would come out just like before --a staggering fifty four cents less than what our calculations revealed here previously without any reduction taking place!
