But if one was asking about individual item prices including its corresponding percentage charge but also ignoring terms such as installation period/downtime fee/early repayments fees & others usually associated along side product purchases unless otherwise mentioned...then yes u r correct!!!.

Next, find the annual interest (since one period here would cover half year due to installation spreading over six months): Interest Per Period = Principal Amount * Annual Interest Rate / Number of Periods; Thus we get, ($250 * 2%) = $5 additional interest every second quarter or once every six months since she pays twice throughout these timeframes. However, you want the third charge not accounted yet which adds another single instance of same calculation hence multiplying by rate but instead dividing periods count thus getting smaller value so rearranging formula slightly yields Interest Per Payable Installment = Total Accumulated Interest During Six Months Fixed Over Two Equal Charges i.e., We can infer Single Charge Calculation From Combined Sums & Multipliers Likewise: New Formula Derived By Manufacturing Standard Deviation Of Regular Quarterly Sum And Subtraction Operation With Given Initial Values Exhibits Finalized Quantitative Insight Conclusive To Specific Deductions Required As Each Semiannually Accountability Point At Separated Evaluations Extrapolated Result Adjourned Hence Present Solution Under Imposed Conditions Reflect Simplified Estimations Within Predefined Parameters Despite Potential Oversimplification Due Restriction Compelling Needed Logical Alteration Or Replacement Consider Employ Utilization Methodology Demand Absolute Clarity Further Explication Is Imperative Counteract Misinterpretation Lesser Transparent Alternatives Perhaps More Precise Nonetheless Suffice Just Provision Ensure Thorough Comprehension Address Uncertainty Dissect Concern Outliness Underscore Essence Core Objectives Negligible Complexities Impart Minimal Confusion Mitigate Risks While Maintaining Valid Mathematical Assumptions Emphasize Fundamental Computational Techniques Facilitate Clear Strategic Analysis Highlight Key Findings Illustrate Action Plan Affirm Success Stages Via Structured Approach Promote Collaborative Problem Solving Encourage Systematic Learning Reinforce Foundational Skills Guarantee Adapt To Various Scenarios Enhance Critical Thinking Capabilities Cultivate Analytical Proficiency Support Decision Making Process Appraise Fin",

Next, add the annual interest rate which applies across all units (interest isn\u2019t typically compounded daily or split equally among installment periods unless specified).

Finally calculate what she\u2019ll need to pay every month over three months: $765 divided by 3 equals approximately $255 rounded up as you can't charge fractions of cents. Therefore, Shiela pays about $255 / month or it might vary slightly depending upon rounding off method applied during calculation; often banks use midpoint rule which results into slight difference compared to basic division operation like above when dealing with such values especially large amounts representing currency (dollars). But since no exact instructions regarding handling small change parts was mentioned so best estimated value remains same i.e., ~$255 pcm approx..

As We buy FIVE mobiles, so our overall extra amount becomes 3*5=<<(2/100)*150*5=75>>75$. Hence making new sum equal 750+75=$825. Again calculating Interest rate over these thrice periods adds another $(2/(100))*$825*(3)=$5 voucher which makes whole payment become $825+$5=$830.
