Since only half decided not to go back into workforce when injured earlier, hence current employees would remain same i.e., 40 \u2013 (current_employees/2).

That brings down our possible answers considerably leaving out either b ),c),e).. However even within just multiplying integers none seem quite right but seeing here its important note regarding numerical accuracy versus rounding up values especially during calculations dealing mainly human resource matters thus concluding your question doesnt appear complete nor precise enough without additional context surrounding specific demographic distributions mentioned elsewhere perhaps something related towards average age ranges ages.. Or again possibly lack clarity over whether someone might actually take multiple positions simultaneously i mean nobody really takes both jobs allotted under said circumstance anyway hence why im asking myself what assumptions others may hold dearly concerning such issues based mostly off generalizations made throughout society itself making things confusing like always! But ok well lets try working around certain factors knowing roughly estimated population groups per job title could come into picture helping narrow focus somewhat maybe getting closer actual figures required vs guesses taken place earlier instead focusing heavily upon theoretical mathematics behind calculation processes further complicating issue entirely regardless though surely everyone wants accurate results rather guessing unnecessarily potentially causing huge problems down road due simple miscalculations unknowingly caused simply trying too hard avoid errors leading wrong conclusions altogether ultimately ending disastrously unless proper care taken whenever doing math works etc!!
