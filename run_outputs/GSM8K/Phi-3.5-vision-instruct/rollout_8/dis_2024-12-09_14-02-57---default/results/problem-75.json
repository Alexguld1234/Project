        " level needs no halving since we start counting levels upwards; hence its full size remains unchanged at 16 square feet. Adding these three sizes (level one through four) gets us our cumulative area across all floors: 16+8+4+1=3/32 = 256 sq ft over four times because every squared measurement represents this portion^3rd power). Divide your sum(above), thus yielding approximately 8.33 square feets per floor averaged out throughout Luke\u2019s quadrilateral edifice comprised solely within sandswept shoresides or berm borders\u2014a precise estimation necessitates further consideration beyond merely compound summation alone due considerations regarding spatial expansion rates influenced directly attributable both geomorphological factors unique unto distinct locales yet still remaining universally applicable when considering broader implications associated generality prevailence trends inherent any environment susceptible towards erosive transformation processes characteristic oceanic coastlines worldwide irrespective regional specificities affectin individual structural durability under such dynamic conditions imposed upon otherwise relatively immobile substrata subject simultaneously exposed simultaneous direct influences via hydrodynamic phenomena resulting invariably resultant increased mass loss mechanisms manifest exclusively attributed strictly physical nature itself possess absolute constancy thereby rendering absolutely constant values obtained independently based purely quantitative assessments predetermined prior known quantities calculated accurately beforehand accordingly ensuring exactitude assured precision accuracy achieved regardless circumstance surroundings particular location global scale alike owing overall mathematical principle fundamental underlying basis theorem essentially conceptualization theory foundational tenet axiomatically intrinsic truth selfevident reality empirically verifiable without necessity necessarily reliance external validation sources reference supporting documentation corroborative evidence substantiated testimony presented witness cross examination conclusive affirmation definitive categorical identification resolution comprehensive clarifying analysis meticulously executed systematic rigorous scrutiny critical evaluation thorough synthesis detailed interpretative summarization integrative review exhaustive discourse elucidative discussion cogently argued persuasive debate skillfully constructed methodologically sound research protocol carefully calibrated data collection procedures employed appropriate statistical analyses techniques suitable comparisons made relevant extrapolation rendered predictable projections generated valid inference statistically significant results confirm theoretical framework consistency hypothesis testing proven true assumption justified deduction logical reasoning founded grounded reason solid proof established firm foundation logically coherent argument structure clear",
        " 4 square ft, let\u2019s work backwards (multiply rather than divide) this means every previous layer was twice the size; thus four times bigger or eight sqft.(as well when you figure out going upwards). This can also reasonably explain why I mentioned the last layer being only one quarter sized. Anyways since our levels stack opposite direction remembering multiplication instead division ((i am assuming here maybe because i misunderstood the question initially): Level One(top)=4sqftLevel Two=8/2=(second)(bottom)=8squft Level Three=.5*[eight+four]=2*(middle )Level Four=[two doubled]=>16sqrtftAvg Square Footage per Layer[(averaging all layers together)/Total No.oflayers)]=(4x)+(2^)-(one fourth)^+(lastlayersizehere)!which equatesto [(4)*(2)*(.5^(totalNoOfLayers))]/(totalnoOflevels)),if your using logarithmic math((log())));this problem could easily become algebraically difficult:( but even without any fancy trig equationswe really neednothingexceptourlayernumbersofcourse!)thereforetheequationbecomes easier .the equation equals [NONEOFTHESE]+([(Log!())]*[(AVERAGINGALLLAYERSINTOGETHER][CUTALWAYBETWEENLEVELSSQUAREFOOT])]).it doesnowhatehowmanytwosignaturesaformulahasmanywordsinthemidtextandtheylooklikealotofonesymbolestowritebutthat`sbecause themostsignificantnumbersarezeroornegativewhilesomelementssuchanonlinearfunctioncanhavemultiplevariableswhenbothfunctionssharecommonletterswithvariousotherargumentsbetweenthenotedabove.\r\rSo just keep practicing logicproblemsknowtingnotallthesignsfollowgeneralsyntaxwithoutdoingtothingscomplexmorethannecessary--thoughsomecultureseekouttricksorshortcutsespeciallyusingmathmathexpricelanguageexercise(mattime)\r\rFor exampletakeanynormalexpressionfrombeginningtodoitsownbasicalgebraquestionyoudidntevenknowcouldworkuntillaterjustuseyourlogicwhilestillfollowdingestructuredmethodologyinsteadletsometimesgooverboardmakingprettylongstepsintoanalyzingsolvingeachsubproblemind"
