        " Katy uses a combined amount equaling these 20 parts as described in your question which stands for both sugar and water separately. We know the actual value represents here is 120 units or portions since one portion corresponds approximately per part i.e., 'a single unit'. Thus every partition equates to ~5 units because  120/20=6 -> hence roughly ,(~5). Therefore following their ratios proportionately; Teaspoons of Sugar would represent about   7*(~5)=35 while Cups of Water accounts for around    13*(~5)=65 units overall adding up precisely into our mentioned sum being 120. To conclude within contextual limitations considering fractions aren't viable options, round off appropriately can result either slightly overestimated figures but essentially remain highly accurate .

To find the amount of single unit i.e., 'Tea', let us first subtract out quantity present in mixture calculated before; which was actually required addition (+).

Further substituting their values into above calculation yields thus;\\( 7+(Added)_toFind=13*[x]\\); or, ``\\( (7)+([added])=\\left(\\frac{13*(addition)}{eachunit}\\right)\\)`` Solving further gets derived resultant value representing multiplication factor applicable within individual item components.\\[\\begin{split}& \\\\ &\\\\&&& Additional Value =\\ (\\text {multiplication_factor})[-(\\text{(calculated\\_value)})]= -\\Bigg(-6[(Subtractive\\;from \\;total)-7\\,or\\,\\,(subtractableFrom \\,increaseInWeight)]\\bigg)\\\\ \\\\ &&&=-\\big[-6*\\left((13 -\\,seven)\\,for\\text{:}\\,\\textrm{Calculations})\\big]\\end{split}\\\\ \\] Hence obtained weight increase comes off when factored back onto original sum computed previously earlier upon mixing procedure .
