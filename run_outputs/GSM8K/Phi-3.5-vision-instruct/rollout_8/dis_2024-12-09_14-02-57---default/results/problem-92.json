As Jacksoinn comes before Jordan so following sequence might result in him having less age when comparing ages within context i.e., David > Robert > William > Benjamin => Ben -> Jamie & Jacob -->James-->Amy --Corey(oldest) This may not work perfectly but logically makes sense since every child below Andrew gets lower alphabetical ranks therefore decreasing their probable numerical value due to common first names frequency amongst population. Based purely off available direct comparisons however without any clear indicator showing exact ordering rules set forth throughout text snippet itself none conclusive deductions regarding specific individual dates nor precise identification towards single identifiable subset exist except possibly potential correlation drawn through initial character usage patterns listed already noted above thus proving quite challenging indeed attempting such calculation solely using presented clues! Nevertheless considering simple birth orders scenario keeping family relation structure intact along w/additional detail considerations concerning gender relevance matters whilst avoiding assumptions beyond initially stated facts pertainingly involved parties thereby prevent undue speculation unrelated factual elements potentially leading erroneous results\u2026but again emphasize absence lack clarity prevents accurate pinpointing certain date particularities associated specifically tied exclusively uniquely onto singular identified entity residing said household environment accordingly retain overall caution approach adopt generalizations cautiously proceed maintain vigilant stance observe comprehensive analysis conduct thorough evaluation encompass entire spectrum possible interpretative angles allow flexibility accommodate ambiguities address concerns methodologically eliminate confusion strategically enhance understanding fully understand implications ultimately gain insightful insights navigate effectively solve intriguing mystery await discovery keen analytic skills shine illuminate path way forward achieve desired outcome successfully triumph challenge posed ahead time test patience focus determination commitment ensure solution achieved satisfying resolution emerges delightfully reward victorious journey pursued confident strides conquer obstacles overcoming hurdles meticulously plot carefully constructed master plan execute skillfully flawlessly bring problem solver role accomplished task completed satisfactorily enjoy newfound accomplishment bask radiantly earned glory",
