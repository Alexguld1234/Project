        " on Friday. The mechanic only worked on fixing car tires without working on truck tires this time around but it fixed double amount than what he normally works on daily as stated earlier in question which means he would make twice as well. Since one set consist in making four times ten dollar bills(totaling upwards of forty), having another set mean eighty twenty dollar notes. This translates mathematically into multiplication or doubling since when you multiply something else its quantity increases proportionately therefore; being consistent based upon past practices we can easily conclude here multiplying sixteen (which denotes twelve) amounts hence implying that if sixty came about via single pairings fifteen pairs shall yield three hundred worth of payments thus ensuring continuity within their operating principles during normal schedules unless specifically noted otherwise due business logic reasons primarily because nothing alters these basic values/functions whilst taking necessary actions related directly towards service rendering efforts including maintainability costs across various vehicle types under consideration i..

Therefore, overall on Thursday, the mechanic garnered $360 + $160 = $520 as revenue. Next, we determine what happened during business operations on Friday. During this particular working day only four sets of auto parts (each set correspondingly costs $40) were worked upon which resulted in gains amounting to precisely 4 * $40 = $160 without accounting the absence of automobile engine assembling tasks. Finally comparing both results obtained above i.e., $520 versus another $160 worth gain; it becomes obvious that when juxtaposing those figures one may observe greater financial success ($520 \u2013$160) occurred via professional service execution throughout the previous week\u2019s period commencing initially within workweek\u2019s second schedule block or commonly known amongst labour industry employees under common nomenclature \u2018Thursday'.

Thus, comparing both scenarios, Friday saw greater income than Thursday ($480 >$520). Therefore, the difference in their incomes equaled Sunday\u2019s profit minus Thursday\u2019s loss which results being 480-520=-($140), hence negative because Thursday yielded lesser revenue relative to Friday. Consequently, if this was incorrectly interpreted into positive gains, the real figure would amount upwardly towards zero not surpassing such sum considering our initial comparison revealed Monday's lower returns versus Tuesday profits i.e., Saturday brought better fortunes within these specific parameters despite numerical increase over previous dates indicating potential fiscal growth.

        " Friday; since no truck tires needing repair happened but 12 new ones occurred we get 12 * $40 equal to $480. Hence it can be said that if you subtract Tuesday\u2019s revenue ($520) minus Wednesday\u2019s revenue($480), You would see that Saturday (the previous weekend didn\u2019t count as only four automotive technicians weren\u2019t working).

        " truck tires were repaired on Friday, we know the only source of income came from fixing the car tires alone. Therefore, comparing these amounts shows us Friday (with $480) made less than Thursday ($520). This means Thursday generated more revenue compared to Friday; hence Monday produced additional $$520-$480=$40$ worth of extra value or profit as it brought greater sales revenue when compared against its counterpart weekend period. Thus, if asked about 'how much''' one would use '$40'. And remembering our original question\u2014\"How much '''more'''\" hints towards subtraction being necessary here rather adding since seeking increase over lower base point(Thursday), resulting conclusion says \"$40\".",

This way your working out looks like this; $((\\mbox{'truck price'})\\times (\\mbox{'number of items sold'}))-((\\mbox{'car price'})\\times (\\mbox{'number 'of Items Sold'}))$which yields us $(\\$60)\\times(6)-(\\$40)\\times(12)$or as expected,$360-$480=\\$(\u2212$$120$).
