Thus we understand here, instead of candice having initially only these 80 stickies but first using up all those when placing them onto coffees (subtraction), it means additional sticks need come into play i.e., purchasing new ones would complete process leaving just few extra around not fully utilized yet(addition). To solve such problems typically involves combining original count+newly acquired minus current sum=used plus leftover_unspent . From context clue 'she had 23 post-it Notes remained overall'.
