Therefore, the detailed calculation becomes too large hence rounded off since humans typically use whole numbers or simple fractions to calculate these kind of tasks, rather than complicated decimal values exceeding hundredth place. Hence rounding can simplify our calculations while retaining reasonable accuracy.

Regarding their spending on fruits, if it was \"$4.50 less\" than what they spent on entries overall (\"$20\"), then Fruit Total=$15.5; dividing amongst people equally would mean Spent_each = [($20+$15.5) / 3] ~= \\frac{~$11}{person}.

        " Spending $4.50 less on food means their spending was (20.25 - 4.5) + ((20.25 - 4.5)/3)=$11.5 + $2.5= $14.

Splitting this equally amongst themselves yields us; divide(100.5, 3)=$33.5. Each friend paid about $33.5 extra aside from buying admission separately as calculated earlier i.e., dividing individual share amounts like admissions alone or combined items/services etc. Hence each contributory fee towards shared experiences such as games would naturally increase when considering group dynamics & sharing responsibilities while travelling en masse irrespective whether these activities occurred post attraction viewings unlike mere snack purchases precluding needless additional transactions thereby increasing account totals indirectly thus elevating personal contributions marginally but significantly upon division through mutual agreement ensuring equitable distribution without undue strain nor dissatisfaction caused due excessive disparities resulting possibly unfair situations emerging eventually leading potential discord affecting social relationships adversely necessitating intervention subsequently compromising harmony sought hereafter hence requiring resolution before damage extends beyond containment limit potentially escalating conflict severity irreparably inflicting long last effects despite temporary remediations offered merely palliative measures preventing further erosion essential maintain communal solidarity intact allowing peaceful coexistence within said confines avoidance entirely unnecessary prolongation agitation reducing coherent interactions fostering amiability strengthening bonds formed throughout event duration encouraging positive encounters facilitative progression rather negative antagonism restricting productivity hindrances causing downtime amidst festivities contrary prevailant normatives beneficial establishments cultivating camaraderie prosperous outlook collectively pursued optimistically promoting progress forward unity building bridges linking participants across societal spectrum ultimately achieving desired objective successful collaboration achievable under considerate framework inclusive mindset reinforcing respect boundaries preserving values personhood integrity fundamental principles justice universality equal opportunity inclusion diversity understanding",
