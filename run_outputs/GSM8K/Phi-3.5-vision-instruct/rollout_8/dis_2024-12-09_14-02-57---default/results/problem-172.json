Next figure out Bird One & Bird Three ' s collective timeline without data pertaining specifically towards individual names instead just grouping all remaining unknown entities together since lack specific identifiers allows us exclude irrelevant variables while keeping relevant ones intact using logic deductively applying previous calculations until reach desired outcome..
