Starting backward counts through groups onto single digits before moving forward into larger groupings later while also working towards smaller quantities within overall totals simultaneously taking advantage whenever possible multiple factors present during problem resolution etc ... Another option exists although admitted difficulty level significantly higher compared previous approaches discussed earlier thus making less convenient under certain situations due complexity involved considering several variables requiring simultaneous attention throughout entire solution process....

But here\u2019s something important to keep in mind; since initially you start off only counting full integers as counts per whole individual item(a single Jigsaw Piece), any non integer part cannot occur physically hence rounding down might work well too although mathematically its not possible exactly .
