Lastly, she purchased 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen resulting in a cost of 6 x $55 = $330. To find out the overall amount paid to all three pastry varieties together we need to sum those amounts; thus, it\u2019ll equal $204 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $330 (cheesecakes) equals altogether $694. Thus the full price including all variations comes to exactly $$$ 694 .
