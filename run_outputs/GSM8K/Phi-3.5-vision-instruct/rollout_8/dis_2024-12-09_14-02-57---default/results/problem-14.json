        " jazz dance among this group of remaining students. It is stated that it was equal to 25%, which means these (number) students would constitute .25 * 16 = <<0.25*16=4>>4 students. Subtracting the participants of both genres, we can determine the amount still interested in learning Hip Hop Dance genre. Therefore, out of initial 20 members participating only in Hip Hop equals 20-(4+4)=<<20-(4+4)=12>>12 or simply put , all but ten percent joined dancing together hence what % remained ? Thus when asked \u201cwhat % remain,\u201d remember it refers back to your original population of interest here being referred as \u2018class\u2019 so if you subtract directly without considering the other data provided against them just look into the remainder i.e., calculate [all/along] \u2013[removed]/total_population => thus ~~percentage~~ remains  \u2248 %.
