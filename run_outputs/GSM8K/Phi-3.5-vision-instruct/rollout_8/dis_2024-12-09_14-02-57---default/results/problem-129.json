        " because doctor rates are provided per hour (there are 60 minutes in one hour). Thus, it means every visit takes up 24/60=0.4 hour. Therefore, all visitors amounting to 500 use about  500*0.4=<<500*0.4=200>>200 hrs altogether daily.. Given the pay rate ($150) multiplied by work duration yields their earnings as being 150*200=$ <<150*200=30000>>30000$ collected daily from consultations which would imply monthly revenue approximates $((month*days)/360)=((30*30)/360)*[($30000)+[$30*(x%)]]. To determine what percentage ((or proportion)) needs to apply [(($30+$150)(per person))] such that income surpasses costs consider expenses or loss due primarily to equipment; namely herein stated:$([expense]) [where ]$.

        " means converting minutes into hours i.e., divide by 60 (as one hour equals sixty minute). So 24/60=0.4 hours per visit. With 500 such visits every day ,total daily duration needed would thus equal: 500*0.4=200 hours. As it takes four times as long working than being billable since only half their wages can go towards fees(i.e,. outpatients), this actually translates to 200 / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 billing hours which yields 50*$150=$<<50*150=7500>>7500 revenue generated by doctors alone. And if you add the cost to run said facilities during those operational hours ($) multiplied against what gets billed($)*in essence the loss here becomes;$200-$150 or $50 losses accruing themselves onto the hospitals expenses . Therefore ; Revenue Earnings - Cost Expenditure leaves us :  7500-(Revenues not factored)= income before deducting overhead costs & taxation considerations but let\u2019s simplify further so assume no deductions yet resulting simply through math perspective -> Profits come down upon subtracting actual earnings ie ~~TotalBilledVsPaidOutToHospital~~ minus potential savings possible under negotiation scenarios-> roughly speaking perhaps due roundabout negotiations bringing figures below stated expectations hence yielding profits reduced proportionately..
