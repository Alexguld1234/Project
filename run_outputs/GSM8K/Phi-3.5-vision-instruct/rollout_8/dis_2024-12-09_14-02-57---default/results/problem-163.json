To solve problem according rule we take $$$ price per item not exceed value calculated before condition apply but actual actions taken based upon conditions stated so Total amount spent on Cars= Number Of Cars*Action Figure's Equivalent Value; which equals $$$$(Number Of Cars)*Value Per Doll From First Setence Before Correction As Much We Know : NoDols+Cals=$Total Amount Spent ,We can Use These Two Statement Combined:$NoCars*PerCarCost+$PerFigureCost*(NofFigures)+AmountSpentOnJustOneDoll,$Since It Wasn't Specified What Exact Were Figured Out Nor Just One Dog was Mention Here You Can Find All Necessary Variables By Simply Substituting what you Knew About Each Item Explicitly Defining Their Specific Values And Solving Either Algebraic Or Through Calculations Whatever Method Fits Yoy Will Get ",
        " which would sum up to 5 * $20 = $100 since every red car equals 4 action figures or three times a specific object not mentioned here ($5). We also know exactly what else items equal; thus without any further assumptions we find that only Action Figures(= Doll) contribute towards this value i.e., their individual values add up to Total Value \u2013 Red Cars\u2019 Values.$23-$10=$13$ hence Each item contributed equally among itself and therefore the collective price of All Toys including both types individually($i.e$,both Action Figure &Doll equalling $\\frac{TotalVal}{No\\ \\ Number}\\of\\toy=(SummationOfIndividualToys)/Number\\\\=\\frac{$23}{(ActionFigure+Doll)}=\\frac{\\ $13 }{\\ Fraction\\ Of\\ IndividualObject}.)$ This means you need to divide/share them accordingly such that They get same share when split together:$A_F&doll$\\divide\\{CumulativeValue\\} : \\\\ =\\frac{\\ fraction(\\ Sum)}{Sum}\\ frac {\\ {fraction(Redcar)\\*number} +\\ {faction(Actionfigure)+faction(dog)}}{\\sum fractions}\\\\ $$= $$\\Bigg\\lgroup$$\\Bigg (\\frac{redCarCost*\\no.\\ of...}{\\biggr..totalValue}$)$$+\\Bigg\\lgroup$$\\Bigg (\\frac{actiffigurancelementcost\\times noof....}{\\biggr...cumulationvalue}$$)$$ = [\\frac{{20*5}}{23}+\\frac{5*3}{23}]=[\\frac{100}{23}+[ \\frac{15}{23}=\\frac{115}{23}=5]$$ ",
        " their total cost based on condition 2 comes out to be equal to three times their single unit price i.e., 3* $5= $15. Based upon our initial assumption regarding the doll being equivalent to Action Figures or Red Cars(Condition 3) , it follows hereafter, Doll Value Equal To Single Unit Price Of Action Figure OR One Car Or Both; therefore its entire monetary valuation stands equivalently poised either towards ($15). Ultimately amalgamated results indicate Total Cost : RedCars+ActionFigures+$DollValue$=>TotalCost=$100+$15($15 if you follow conditions 1&2 but could also inferred to fit within range $(-$20 according conditional clause ",
        " three times the price of one action figure ($5) plus half the price of one car($20/2). It thus equates to 3*$5+10=$25. Adding up everything together yields $100+$15+$25=$140 which represents what all their respective items amount to when sold individually based on market prices mentioned within instructions text string data . Hence concluding \"$140\". Final "
