Given details about male and female populations which summed equals to certain amount less than this overall figure; we subtract these numbers representing either side combined i.e., those not being categorized as 'kid'. Hence our subtraction would look like so : Overall inhabitants minus males or females respectively results into quantity remaining who falls under third category identified herein within textual bounds namely \u2014 \u2018children\u2019 thus calculation becomes -> Total inhabitants \u2212 (Males+Women)=Children =>  23786\u2212(8417+(9092)).

Thus subtract this value (i.e., Men\u2019s Population+ Women\u2019s Population) from the overall population count. This difference represents child population since all people not classified under male or female categories would logically fall into \u201ckid\u201d category here unless otherwise specified. Therefore, Children in soda equals Total Popn minus AdultPopn i.e.,  23786 \u2013 (8417 + 9092).
