We know this increased cost needs to cover the sale of these quantities plus make extra profits mentioned here above; thus : $30*X = Cost Price To calculate Profit we subtract increase/cost_price= Total revenue This becomes   : $$ \\begin{align*} \\text{Total Revenue} &= \\$30\\times X \\\\[0.5em] (\\$ 20+ \\$ 2)\\times X -(\\$20\\times X)&=\\$400\\\\[0.5em]\\$40X&=\\$400\\\\[0.5em] &=(-\\$40)\\\\[\\cdot\\]&\\Rightarrow\\, X~=&{\\color{brown}\\bf 10~\\rm {bag}}.\\end{align*} Thus $\\mathbf{(a)}$ Since Sawyer spent half of what Nick saved ,Nick saves$\\boxed{$x}=\\$ 20$.
