The total weight would equal 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children), which equals a result of 225lbs. Thus, Ted needs to prepare exactly  225 lb of Potato Salad for the Dinosaur Picnic. This includes satisfying their appetite while considering age differences since it factors into portion sizes being halved based upon whether one consumes less than or greater than what could possibly satisfy 'an average adult'. Hence ensuring nobody goes hungry because even small ones too deserve sufficient food provisions especially when enjoying social gatherings such occasions!

        " all the adults. Since there are 20 adults who will each eat 10 lbs, multiply their consumption together resulting in 20 adults x 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad required for the adults alone. Lastly calculate the total weight necessary based off the quantity consumed per individual plus multiplication into count; Multiplication yields [(20) (10 lb./adult)]+[(5)(child)]=20(lb.)+(5x5)=20+25 which sums up overall food requirement equals 45 kg or approximately 99lbs rounded down considering packaging restrictions . Hence we can conclude ,To sufficiently cater for both youngsters & senior parties one needs only about either :Courtesy @Eastlander_NY https://bit.ly/3tBXWbh ",
        " = 200 lbs of potato salad. Next determine the amount needed pertaining only to children; calculating this means finding out quantity required based upon their food consumption habit. Since it\u2019s known that one child would require or rather can eat upto  5lbs , considering we know about 5 kids attending the function hence allotting them portion accordingly requires you multiply like below .

        " child would consume compared to an adult. As stated, a child consumes only half as much food as an adult which means it takes half the quantity consumed by an average adult i.e., (1/2)x(10lbs). Calculate the overall requirement for all the people who go along including both kids & adults at the event based off this consumption pattern mentioned earlier. We know that according to your question data;there needs to caterfood provisions to serve twenty four adult members plus another fifteen kiddo ones using the following math formula C=(N_A*C)+(N_K*C)/2 Based on above logic calculate our target solution outlined below.

        " child eats (1/2)*10=5lbs of potato salad. Calculate the total quantity needed using multiplication principles according to types i.e., Adult type(A) vs Child type(C). To calculate the total weight required per group first multiply count times individual requirement which results into 'Adult Type':  10*20=200 and similarly resultant calculation yields 'Child Type':   5*5=25 .

        " salad needed for all adults. To get this figure, multiply the quantity consumed per adult (10 lbs) times the number of adult dinosaurs attending (20), resulting in 10lbs/adult \u00d7 20 adults= 200 lbs required . Compute the total weight of potato salad necessary for all kids present at the event. Multiply the consumption rate per kidling (5 lbs) into the count of little ones expected , yielding  5 lbchild\u00d75 kiddies = 25lb requirement    Summarize both amounts obtained above to determine overall resources demanded during the feast. Adding together these requirements results in 200 lbs + 25 lbs = <<200+25=225>>225 lbs Of Potato Salady goodness That represents our solution henceforth And since no specific quantities mentioned before mention it\u2019s not really possible to identify exactly what item refers here But considering general context let's assume 'it'. Translation would read like so Final ",
        " would be 20 * 10 (lbs per adult) = 200 lbs . Do the same calculation for the children also attendance who wish potato salad. Here it says there\u2019re going to be exactly 5 kids at this event. Each kid wants around about  5(lbs/child). That means altogether, you get 5*5= 25 lbs . Add up both amounts calculated so far which represents everything required overall including food consumption made due to presence of big or small guests.. Finally add those totals together \u2013 This leads us towards finding out our solution quite easily without doing any calculations manually again!
