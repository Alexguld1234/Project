        " just multiply .25 (percentage increase) times 4(points per set). We get .25*4 which equals 1 point. Adding our additional one point earned during round B gets us a grand total of 5 points!! ",
        " 1 point. This means in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 points plus this extra 1 point which totals up to (4 + 1) = 5 points during these 20 minutes. Combining both halves together; Mike earned (4+5)=$9$. The answer is: 9.",
        " amount of points he made during those two intervals together we add them up : 4+5= 9 . The answer is: 9.",
