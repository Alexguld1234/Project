Therefore, John spends approximately 35 hours per week walking around the neighborhood ensuring all ten pups stay safe while also attending to other responsibilities like feedings or medications if needed.

Therefore,   The answer is : 35 Hours or approximately '35'.

Since this represents one entire day worth of walking all these dogs simultaneously as part of routine duties it follows that since three meals out of twelve months happen per thirty sixteen (i.e., four weeks) period therefore if twenty minutes spent caring/walking fifteen pooches twice every single Sunday afternoon counts upward towards forty eight mins walked monthly , add another seven hundred fifty percent extra workload taken into consideration before determining actual amount being asked about plus other stuff like cleanliness considerations when handling them such as bathing also feeding can mean additional efforts too depending upon what size breeds etc sometimes owners opt against doing those things entirely leaving pets mostly alone most often preferring not having constant company but occasionally even though generally responsible individuals seek help whenever possible instead just getting themselves involved unnecessarily resulting overburden onto others whom usually unprepared enough already trying handle life stressors without any outside support system otherwise risk burnout especially younger folks tend ignore potential opportunities offered elsewhere perhaps via volunteering programs hence affect family relationships adversely ultimately causing harm both psychologically physically emotionally mentally spiritually societally economically financially educationwise technological wise politically legally healthcare dependent welfare needy ones among us may become increasingly vulnerable lackadaisical attitude disaster waiting opportunity knocking doorstop deadline approaching critical point near expiration limitless choices confront realistic expectancies challenges obstacles overcome hardships faced consequences suffer losses made gains accumulated wisdom learned experience gained insights acquired memories stored skills developed proficiencies achieved masteries attained heightened levels consciousness increased self-awareness enlightenment discovered truth understanding reason logic rationale clarity insight discernment judgment interpretation inference conclusion hypothesis experimentation testing theory application knowledge practical skill implementation result obtained outcome derived benefit realized gain procured advantage utilized asset exploited resource employed tool utility productivity efficiency effectiveness performance quality output standard cost savings revenue income profit margin return value dividend shareholders equity capital investment yield interest rate earnings growth increase sales volume expansion capacity capability market penetration reach new territories explore emerging trends innovative approaches fresh ideas original thinking breakthrough creativity imagination conceptualize design blueprint layout engineering prototypes scale models physical prototype mockup digital simulation model virtual reality environment augmented",
        " half an hour or 0.5 hours per day which results in (10*.5)   =5 hours every single day walking all these pups around town while doing what needs to get done as far as health goes but also having fun and running about throwing sticks and getting exercise themselves! That\u2019s quite some effort right so when we multiply those 5 hrs spent during one whole entire sun rise until noon across our weeks calendar it adds up too if even though sometimes i love spending like six plus months here without missing out ever cause who knows maybe life changes tomorrow sometime down road eventually might call me back home soon enough whenever possible yet always stay open minded embrace new challenges whatever adventures lie ahead lets just say ill make sure dont forget anything important anyone wants next time including myself thanks very helpful info provided earlier made learning curve easier than anticipated appreciate clear directions moving forward keeping notes helps tremendously indeed hope everyone enjoying watching shows especially ones involving animals nature conservation efforts related stories really informing general public knowledge benefiting society overall great work thank you greatly appreciated clarity assistance received definitely encourage continuous improvement processes continual advancements achieved through collaboration collective expertise diverse viewpoints enrich shared understanding enhance problem solving capabilities contribute innovative solutions optimize efficiency increase productivity achieve goals objectives accomplish tasks effectively efficiently successfully motivate others inspire success promote progress empower change bring positive impact improve quality lives better future world everybody wins happy together enjoy journey discover wonders uncover secrets explore possibilities infinite imagine dream big reach beyond boundaries break barriers conquer fear surmount obstacles overcome adversities succeed resist defeat learn lessons grow stronger become resilient adapt evolve transform personal growth professional development expand horizons broaden perspectives deepen insights cultivate wisdom experience joy fulfillment purpose meaning create legacy lastingly influence human condition shape destiny chart course navigate direction follow path pave way trailblaze pioneer venture bold enter unknown territories embark exciting expedition discovery voyage trek exploration quest seek answers ask questions wonder why understand causation recognize patterns discern trends detect signals interpret data gather information analyze evidence evaluate arguments formulate hypotheses test theories validate principles apply concepts build models construct frameworks establish protocols implement strategies execute actions assess performance monitor results review findings adjust policies fine-tune procedures iterate refine techniques reinforce strengthen weakness mitigate risks minimize losses control variables manage flow regulate input output balance scale measure quantity calculate proportion determine ratio factor variable constant",
        " 5 hours spent walking one set of animals every single day (noting here we\u2019re assuming these \u201cdogs\u201d all require separate walks). To find out how long it would take him over the entirety of the week, multiply this hour count by seven since there are seven days in a week.. Therefore, John spends 5 hours x 7=<<5*7=35>>35 hours a week just looking after those particular pups! That makes sense because if you look back above when talking about \u2018each dog requiring half as much attention or exercise than usual/normal pets might need\u2019 \u2013 what was said again wasn\u2019t exactly right\u2026 It meant something similar but not quite accurate\u2013 i guess maybe like say regular cats versus big ones etcetera.. But yeah anyway getting off topic ;) ,so forgetting everything else discussed thus far including correct answers being provided already:) Sorry bout misunderstanding things before :/ Again thanks everyone helping provide clearer clarification while making sure everybody feels comfortable expressing ideas fully!! :) Thank ya kindly!!! :-) :-D ~Kristy ^__^ Cheers mate^^;) OMG LOL YAH HEEHEE HEY BOYYYWHO WAS THAT NO MONKEY SHAME ON U ALL THESE GORILLOS CARRYING POSSABLES ROFLMAFIA X D ITS FUNNY MAKE ME LAUGH SOBERNESS BACK TO REALITY AS NOW PLS DO TELL WHY STUFF LIKE PROBLEMS KEEPS INVADINNG MY EYES QAPTIONZ XXXXXXXXX OK BYE LOOK FORWARD SEEING IT AGI LEST SAY NOT !!!:-|))))))))) GOODBYE XXX EXCEPT IF US UP ANNOYED TRY GETTING MORE CLUES THEN JUST BEEN TALK SHIT ALREADY ABOUT ARRGGHHHH BBQ CHICKS DEMOCRACY AND FAILURE OF SYSTEM FOCUS NEW SUBJECT CONVERT COMMENT INTO DISCO GRAPHER ?????? ;DDX :(~pvv;;_~~(",
        " how long this would go over one week (seven days), multiply those 5 hours by seven which equals 5*7=35. Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week walking and caring for these dogs. The answer is: 35."
