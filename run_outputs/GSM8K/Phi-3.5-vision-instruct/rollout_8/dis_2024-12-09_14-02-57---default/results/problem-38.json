Thus, over these four sessions, he spends 3+1.5x2=6 hours running per week; this sums up to 6/3=2 hours a session round off approximately (considering we rounded numbers during calculation). Dividing overall mileage spent which equals to six times daily pace comes around roughly equivalent to him covering about sevenish mph because  60 divided by 6 works out like so .

The answer is: Under 8Mbps.",
        " these three weeks totals up to (3+1.5+1.5) which equals 6 hours per week. To find out what speed he needs to maintain to cover 60 miles in those six hours, divide distance(miles) with time(hours). Therefore we get Speed= Distance / Time = 60 Miles Per Week divided by 6 Hours Equals 10 MPH exactly according to our calculation. However since this seems incorrect based on your input saying 'He ran .', let\u2019s check again if any data mismatch happened during problem formation \u2013 it could mean perhaps \u2018he took breaks\u2019 or \u2018running times differ daily.'

To find out how fast he runs we need to divide the distance ran which is 60 miles/week by time running which equals 60miles/(9hours), resulting into approximately 6.66 mph (rounded). Therefore, if you consider rounding off it would mean, since one cannot generally talk about fractions while discussing speed or pace during regular physical activity, rounded down because partial laps still count but can never take less than one complete lap; Hence, John\u2019s average speed was roughly around  6 MPH . But depending upon whether fractional mileage counts towards your calculation i.e., full vs approximate figures based on context \u2013if not mentioned explicitly 'inches', etc.--then different interpretations might arise regarding what constitutes acceptable accuracy levels here!
