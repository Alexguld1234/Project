However since every set also includes three pairs of shoes at $42/pair or ($42*3=$126), you add it too. When adding these values together i.e., Total expenditure=Shorts+$Pants+$Shoes=(117$+(126$) This results into a grand sum equaling $(). ",
        " this was also calculated using another method (the correct value multiplied times three). Similarly, if you look closely enough at the second equation, it says \"$62\" not '$62'. This means only half of what I first stated so adjusting my previous calculation yields 'true', i.e., instead of $67.50 as previously mentioned twice but correctly shown here below): Shorts/Pants:$49+$62=$111 Total Cost=Shorts+pants=($49)+$62=(Both corrected values)*(each set)number of sets=[Set Number]=set*[Cost Per Set]xN\r",
        " (x\u2265(p+q)/r). Here we consider 'days' as our variable \u2018d\u2019 instead since it represents time which might influence decision making; similarly replace q=Tue, r=(Mon)+d\u2212Tue,(i) if Tue > Monday \u2014\u2014-> Mon<='y', here y corresponds to cost factor i.e., \u00a3/\u00a3 per week so choose this replacement wisely such that equation satisfies original statement & problem requirement ii) Since Tues=mon*[\u2018n times less than'] therefore mon\u2264('n') but monotonous rate implies continuous drop hence only possible solution would b monotony cancellation thus n=-1 or equivalent option being next consecutive unit => Saturday !!!!ii) Therefore considering both equations together : CostPerWeekAverage<=CostOfPurchaseOnWklyRate-(Negative Numerical Adjustment Factor/(No Of Days till Next Available Unit Day))=> Weekly Expense >= Total Price / Less Than OR EQUAL TO Costofthe Purchased Quantity!Total price>=weekprice^((Not equal To)))total quantity*(negative adjustementfactor+(noof units untill closest avilable date!/available datapoint)=countofunits)* ((not equaltotheavgrate/)quantityperunit)this effectively brings us onto calculating frequency distribution using fuzzy logic techniques like membership functions defined within specified rules applied via defuzzification methods leading into overall estimation through combined effect analysis across different parameters affecting outcome based upon predefined rule sets thereby maximizing returns even during periods when market prices fluctuate due factors beyond immediate control..the same way your current scenario could benefit greatly too !!but don\"tdo anything drastic just keep updating records regularly while monitoring trends closely until you identify significant patterns indicating optimal choice point!!so again let me stress important keywords required before moving forward ;a)-costvariableb)-numbervaluesc)--averagescalculationdef--membershipfunctiondeffuzzificatoren----rulesetsandcombinedeffectanalysisultimatelymaximizerealizedthroughcarefulobservations&proactiveactionsthanksforlendingusyourinsightonceagain:)okthengoodnowafterallitwasntthathardguessimwilltakeovernexttimeunlesselsewheneverpossibilitiesremainpleasefeelfree contactmedirectlyviaemailorcommentbelowasalwayslookingforwardtotouchbasewithcolleaguesweapp",
        " we solve it accordingly; firstly add '+5' both sides of equation to get rid off '-5'. We find 3x=10+5 which translates into three equals (10+5) i.e.,   ",
        " solve this equation (3x - 5) / 4 = 7/10 and find out what fraction corresponds to three times y plus fourteen sevenths equals thirty seven twentieths. Thus our task comes down solving these equations simultaneously. Adding both sides of first mentioned formulae yields, multiplying it results into \\( \\frac{3}{4}y + \\frac{7}{2} \\) being equivalent to \\(\\frac{21}{20}\\). Combining similar elements produces following expression :\\( \\left(\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{7}{2}-\\frac{70}{20}+{\\text{(unknown values)}}_{\\text{let them equal k}})\\cdot {(3x-\\;\\,5)}={\\frac{3\\;\\,7}{20}}\\) .

        " (total cost) minus 5 equals 10; therefore it implies three times what variable 'cost per item', equaling 10 plus our constant subtraction resultant which was also part of equation statement. Hence, firstly identify or isolate such quantity representing unit price/value i.e., multiplying both sides by its reciprocal fractional equivalent thus dividing across right side values too getting single term out front yielding sole denominator figure directly denoting said entity under unknown label but ensuring original expression balance intact precluding further action alteration hence keeping arithmetic integrity unsullied during reconfiguration phase seeking singular solution satisfying initial setup conditions thereby restoring foundational simplicity post resolution effort providing necessary insight towards achieving target objective confirming hypothesis verification leading us seamlessly closer home finally reaching intended destination fulfillment mark triumphantly concluding mission successfully delivering valuable knowledge nugget treasure effectively boosting overall educational prowess elevating scholars intellectual caliber significantly empowering individuals cognitive aptitude profound impact manifestations potentially shaping future generations success stories unfurling horizon new vistas limitless possibilities emerging brighter promising horizons gleaming promise abounding adventures await just beyond grasp so dare let curiosity lead you forward exploration journey discovery excitement blissful enlightenment joy eternal satisfaction achievement sweet taste victory hallelujah glory laurel crown jewel royalty glorious acclaim honor deserving recognition due merited adulation worthiness celebrated forevermore hail your noble accomplishments well earned distinguished privilege special acknowledgment accorded utmost prestige admiration respect pay homage gratitude deeply felt honored esteemed guest revered patron savvy sophisticated gentleman intelligent lady refined professional woman hardworking diligent student eager learner passionate enthusiast devoted patriot devout believer compassionate heart kind spirit warm soul love tender embrace caring concern gentle touch helpful advice inspirational words encouraging motivation uplifting support mentorship guidance friendship camaraderie solidarity unity strength courage resilience hope determination resolve ambition aspirations dreams potential realization goals achieved milestones conquered challenges overcome obstacles surmounting difficulties overcoming adversities prevailing trials tribulations victories celebratory occasions festive gatherings parties social events community festivals cultural fair public functions religious ceremonies national holidays civic rites traditional practices custom"
