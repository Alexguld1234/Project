        " says Joseph\u2019s spending decreased by \"$60\" during June; you would subtract this amount ($60) away from January's expenditures which comes up as  500 \u2013 60 equals 440 (this represents what happened). Add both together! This leads us onto our last calculation summing them both amounts i.e., Adding Month One Expenditure plus Added Factor minus New Amount. That means we need to add back July(440), April Plus Fifty $(+500)$= Total Spent.(i.e.; addition operation ) Hence adding all three numbers leaves us with:                      , so combining everything together becomes:           ",
        " 500 (i.e., 500 \u2013 60). Therefore, Joe\u2019s spending for June equals ($500-$60), which comes out as $440. To find the sum for both these months, add them up i.e., 500+440=$940. Hence, The total amount consumed over the course of twenty-four hours would equate to this value ($940) since every additional dollar represents one unit incrementing time complexity towards infinity. Thus concluding our computation process; Total Time Complexity -> O(\u221e).
