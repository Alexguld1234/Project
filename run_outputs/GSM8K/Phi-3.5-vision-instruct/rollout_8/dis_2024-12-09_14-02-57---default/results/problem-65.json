It took Thomas 3 hrs longer than Jacob to travel 10 miles due to heavy traffic. James takes twice as much time as Jessica when traveling such distances. If Jacob makes the trip in X minutes and Jessica can make it in Y minures, find the combined time the four will take to finish if they are traveling together.
