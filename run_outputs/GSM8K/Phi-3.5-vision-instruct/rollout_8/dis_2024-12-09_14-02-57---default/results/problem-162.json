        " we need find out what happens over 36 months which equals to 36 / 2 = 18 increments or cycles. Therefore, if one cycle takes us up to $24 per bag, eighteen such cycles can take our initial price ($20), multiplied by 18 resulting in $20*18=$<<20*18=360>>360 as the increase cumulatively during these three years. But this amount represents only additional sum due to incremental raising prices but not including initially present stock so lets add already existing price; hence current value comes down to Initial Price plus raise thus being equal $$$Initial_price+Increase=$$$(Adding both values together results into Total Amount spent). Thus equivavlent overall budget calculation becomes $$$initial_budget+$((number\\_of\\_increases)*(increment/cycle))$; putting all relevant data here leads towards Final ",

This can also help you understand exponential growth better as well; see if ya get me point(!!)
