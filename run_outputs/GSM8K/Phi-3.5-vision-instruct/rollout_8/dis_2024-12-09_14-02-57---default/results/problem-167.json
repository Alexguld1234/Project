Therefore dividing them across; results into x=(8/3),(approximately ~2.66 year older than six months or roughly around August month when most birthdays happen.). This means right now only brook who couldn\u2019t celebrate full bithday yet . But if seth really celebrated every time since all children born before november don\u2019t mind about being young but just love having cakes regardless its actual date..

Therefore our official reply based only on information available up till now contradictory however upon consideration its fair enough that maybe I made mistake typing it before without thinking properly let me restate my initial calculation once again : if b represents brookes age ..then according to question...b+(b+2*2)=28 ...solving....b=(~2/3)*28 ~fourteen point three thirtythree but since age cant be fractional ie not possible hence taking whole no nearby approximate figure means\u2026brooke could barely nineteen approxish considering time elapsed & thus seth having doubled less one year becomes eighteen \u2026thus making him slightly overseventeene plus still keeping approximation logic intact therefore reiterated conclusion accordingly i deduced previously stands valid !Thats why all these ramblings earlier werent needed except clarification :) Hopefully your patience understood!

However if we assume that 'brookie was born once', let B denote Brooke's current age hence   seth(=2B). This implies both equations:    (in 2 year time) :     seth+2+(B+2)=28         which simplifies into       seth+Brooke=24                            thus , solving simultaneously yields        solver{solve((2*b)+b+2==24), b}= {4} Thus      seth=(2x4)=8 . Letting substitute it back into our first equation yielding           brooksage=8/2=4               Therefore          seth's aged currently equals fourteen.(Incomplete assumption made above.)
