        " Since Charleston has four times the number of sheep than Seattle, it means Charleston\u2019s flock would contain 4 * 20 = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep. However, since we know Charlestons farm hosts seven animals less than Tulouges (as per problem), this leads us into having 80+7 =<<80+7=87>>87 sheep within Toulouses farms. Therefore, combining all three townsfolk Tuslowen, Chuckie, and Seattley respectively you sum up their numbers; therefore yielding them collectively owning 20(Seattle) + 87(Charlestown)+87(Tulowens)= <<20+87+87=194>>194 livestock. Thus, adding together these counties yields them maintaining altogether  194 animal figures under care right across said localities.

Therefore summing all three numbers results in  20+80+160 equaling a total of 260 heads or individual animals combined among Sydney, Charleston, and Toulouse. Thus, the collective count amounts up to twelve hundred fifty head(count inclusive of both adult females & juveniles) when considering reproduction cycles involving rams multiplying their initial counts roughly into this figure overtime due to progeny generation being counted separately under these conditions but strictly speaking within one cycle based solely off parental figures provided excludes newborns yet not outweigh other variables involved hence simplifies resulting calculation accordingly .
