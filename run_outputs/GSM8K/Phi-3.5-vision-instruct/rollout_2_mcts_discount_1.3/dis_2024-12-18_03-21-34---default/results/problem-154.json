Compute the same calculation but using different numbers based off the fact that he only teaches twice these lessons every other day (Tue/Thu). This results in calculating four times the base amount because this schedule repeats over half their usual time span due its shorter length relative totime spent taking longer courses(each course takes place for half as often than those earlier mentioned since we doubled it once) thus leading us ultimately toward getting our correct value!

First off figure out seconds\u2019 worth on those alternate weeks using this formula: Total Weekly Hours Alternative Days Per Weeks With Same Time Schedule / Number Of Times That This Occurred;   Finally add all these values together since you want totals overall.. Here goes : ((2*2)+(1*1))*8=32hours+((5*3)*4)=60+=92TotalClassHourPerSemester=92 .So your next question would ask \u2018In months', or if I am asked only what was 'class hour during month?' My guesses include multiplying our results over another unit called period like quarter year , six moth \u2026etc And finally divide everything according too get its value per my needed units .. But i hope u understand till here ...!!!!! :) Keep learning !!! Good Luck! (: Just multiply both sides... It looks something similar right ? Yes , exactly !! You may also refer back as long before & go through first equation again because multiplication property states As whatever happens on either side remains same even while performing mathematical operations.....Good Job !! Absolutely Correct ~ Thank U ^_^ Your understanding matters most! Alright Mr Math Wizard ;) Let me know anytime if clarification required regarding math stuff....Thanks ever ;-) Cheers........ :-)",

Since these are all equivalent amounts we just calculated above this would simply multiply those results together; hence:  9 (hours/week) \u00d7 16 (weeks)= 144 hours over sixteen weeks or twelve months. We also know that twice a month kimo takes additional classes which take up roughly double their original time since it increases them lengthened nearly doubles duration as compared when taking four different lectures throughout out same amount of periods such therefore multiplying our previous value found herewith yields us following sum according too my logic below accordingly :   144 hrs*2(additional lecture lengths)*2=288 hrsthe actual result appears very close yet discreetly differs due factors surrounding academic pursuits typically taken place outside official ones otherwise recognized beyond standard scholarship normative expectations thereby resulting difference however slight though noticeable upon second look back reflecting said scenario precisely while omitting any preexisting misconception about its magnitude whatsoever .

        " 3 days = 9 hours every weekend. Over sixteen weeks, this adds up to  9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours. Next, let\u2019s consider what happens over the other four weekdays \u2014 namely Tuesday and Thursday when Kimo takes part in twice as long \u2013 but shorter duration sessions. Here, Kimo spends 2*2=4 hours per session hence taking him through both meetings leads us to another resultant output of  4 hours/session * 2 sessions/day * 2 days(Tue & Thu)/week = 16 hours /week . Summing these results together yields  144 hours+16 hours/(each meeting) ~~for 16weeks~~\u2248 160 hours throughout any single year span within which academic activity occurs; thus rendering our ultimate conclusion or definitive statement being \u201cduring just under halfway time\u201d into term completion period , approximately sixty percent towards terminal date based upon preliminary computation methods employed herein described above while maintaining adherence consistent accuracy standards requisite integral components underlying formulation procedures utilised amidst evaluations pursuits encompassing educational endeavor quantification endeavors.\u201d ",

        ". On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he also attend 2-hour class twice a week resulting into (2\u00d72)hours/week . Therefore over fourteen weeks ,he would take ((9+2*2)*(16))=96 hrs   Hence we can conclude that; the amount of time that Kimo spends studying during a single course session across all subjects is approximately equal when comparing it with study materials available or online as well..so this translates to 'on average';Kimo takes ~6~hrs per subject according to these results!    However note here if u consider only exams etc & not practice sessions /homework assignments while saying above point bcz tests may vary wrt difficulty levels thus affecting scores differently depending upon topics being tested too unlike studies material wise although i am pretty sure most lecturers dont prefer assessment without practical aspect anyways good luck !!!
