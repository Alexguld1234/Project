        " 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet from the school. Calculate travel time as distance divided by speed for both competitors: Steven takes about 15840 / 440 minutes ~= 36 min(round down), while Tim needs 10560 / 264 hours ~~approximately 40 mins~~ (correct rounding). Therefore, since Steves arrived around midnight when compared againt Tammys arrival which was close towards dawn, we conclude Steve waited longer because although biking allows him faster transportation over short periods due its greater average velocity , it doesn\u2019t always take shorter trips especially if one already starts later like this case study indicates here . Thus finally concluding our result : Winner waits additional time approximately equals difference between arriving times meaning late night owl experience would witness approximate extra quarter hour delay! :) ",

Similarly, Tim traveling twice as far but half the speed i.e., 10560ft / (264ft(mph)) results in around ~40 min approx which means only one second difference.\r Therefore since no person completed journey less than other ,there wouldn\u2019t even wait anybody.. \r",

        " let's use this unit. One mile equals 5280 feet, therefore Steve\u2019s distance (3 miles) converts to 3*5280 = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet while Tim\u2019s distance (2 miles) translates to  2*5280 = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet. Next, calculate time using formula Time = Distance/Speed for both players. Steve would take approximately 15840 / 440 = <<15840/440=36>>36 minutes to reach his place whereas it takes around 10560/ 264 = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes for Tim . As a result, the winning person waits till Tim arrives which amounts up to |Tim_arrival_time \u2013 Steves_arrival_time| or absolute difference i.e., |40minutes \u2013 36 minutess| => They meet during traveling backward since steve finished earlier but tim didn't know about such rule hence answered wrongly due to negative sign indicating direction(backwards).

Next up; calculating timing taken by Tim as well whose travel path totals around half Steven\u2019s \u2014 i.e., about one mile converted into footsteps equalling exactly  5280 feet , but only travelling at 264 foot steps a min. Therefore, doing simple division yields us ~20 mins needed. Comparing these times reveal that Tim arrives earlier hence being faster overall making 'Tim', not 'Steve'.

        " Since he bikes at 440 feet per minute, it takes him 15760 / 440 minutes or approximately 36 minutes. Calculating similarly for Tim; since he rides at 264 feet per minute over a distance of 2 miles converted into feet (which equals roughly 10560), this means it would take around 10560 / 264 minutes or about 40 minutes for Tim. Therefore, as Stewe was faster reaching home, we subtract Steve\u2019s arrival time from Tim\u2019s i.e., 40 \u2013 36 which makes Tim wait for approximately 4 minuts until he gets back while Steve arrived early enough not needing any wait. But if you want just duration till winners arrives : both reach approx same timing , no extra wait expected hence max difference could go upto zero seconds depending upon start timings exact match up . Finally considering smallest possible positive integer value based off common sense scenarios presented here ; ",

Now let\u2019s compute for Tim using similar calculations; since Tim lives twice as far but goes slower we don't need any conversions here because both distances would already be measured similarly if converted back into miles considering inches instead of yards. His traveling period comes down simply by dividing the mileage difference which directly translates into extra wait times once crossed\u2014which means about 24 minutes longer based off initial values stated earlier, thus making his overall rushing time closer around the half way mark assuming constant speeds over these calculated spans without accounting for breaks mentioned otherwise not covered within question constraints explicitly hence remaining solely focused upon pure transit timing factors only).
