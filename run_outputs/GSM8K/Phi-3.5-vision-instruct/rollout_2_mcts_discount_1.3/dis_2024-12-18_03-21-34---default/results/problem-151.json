Add up these amounts to find out Shawna's daily earning which equals $2.50(bikes)+$2.25(tricycles) = $4.75. Hence, she made fourteen seventy-five cent ($ .75 rounded off when dealing with currency). Converting this into dollar terms equates around about $.01 less than half.

Next, calculate the income obtained through services rendered exclusively towards trikes. Note that typically, a standard trike comes equipped with three equally sized wheels unlike typical quadricycles which might come prepared as such but here only 'all tricycle tires,' suggests using three times what was calculated before due to triple axles commonly seen in trikes rather than pairs like those found on traditional quads. That means calculating\\(3 \\text{ persons } \\times 3 \\text{ wheels}/tricycle \\times \\$0.25/\\text{wheel}\\), and finally determine payments made solely attributable toward singularities not requiring any consideration over multiple points hence no additional financial gain can result.
