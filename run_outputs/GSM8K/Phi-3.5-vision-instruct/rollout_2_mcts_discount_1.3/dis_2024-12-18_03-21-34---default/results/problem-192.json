Death reduces this amount to (.6)(130). This comes out as .6(130)= 78 remaining live trees,. Since three percent died we subtract those which leaves us with... ,,,..., so ...remaining live tree=~80!. To find dead or removed non living ones you would just need the original population minus alive one which makes it ~50-. As expected! :) You could solve like I said first using probabilities but your solution seems correct anyways; if anything sorry about my attempt ;-) Have a nice day ;)!!!!!",

Finalizing thus tells about ending status :    Total Living Trees      ~                ~      86. An approximation might suggest less than exact value due to rounded figures used along way ...
