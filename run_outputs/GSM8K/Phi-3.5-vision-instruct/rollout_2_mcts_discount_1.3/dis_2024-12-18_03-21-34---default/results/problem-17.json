Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply these weekly totals by 50 to find out her yearly income which comes to 1150*50= 57500 dollars annually.

As a cheerleader coach, she makes $30 per hour for 15 hours a week, meaning she receives 30 * 15 = $<<30*15=450>>450 monthly working as a coach. This means over a whole year; her income increases by another 450 * 50 = $<<450*50=22500>>22,500. Therefore combining all these sources adds up to $35,000(as a teacher) + $22,500(coaching which equals $57,500 annually). The answer is: 57500.",
        " a year, this means she makes 700 * 50 = 35000 dollars a year teaching students. As a cheerleading coach, if earned pays out 30 USD / hr, and working once shows up every week workshop which lasts about one time (as I understand), it totals 30*15=450$ income generated through coaching over a period of fifty weeks a year. Therefore when adding both jobs together we get 35000+450=$35450 or annually made revenue; hence jills overall paycheck would equal thirty thousand four hundred sixty dollars ($35,460).

Again working only when every other month (half time), so it would mean half pay making it amounting up to 225 *  50 = 11250 dollars annually earned through coaching. Therefore altogether; we add both amounts received throughout the years which comes out to get us 35000+11250=46250 dollars over one year period thus becoming her overall income made during said timespan..theansweris:$46,250 .",

        " makes (20*35) = $700 every week teaching students. Also, since she spends half time coaching for which she receives ($30/hour), we can calculate this amount using similar logic; it would work out like ((30*15)/(1*35))= twice less than being a fulltime student so $(30*(15)*(50\\text{ Weeks})). Therefore altogether annually, over those same working years, she earned($700*(50)+$750)=$38,500.. The answer is:$38,500.",

As coaching, however, it takes her only half (or one fourth) the time it takes to prepare lessons so if preparing classes took her all workweek; being a mentor would take but just fourteen(one fifth). Hence over forty years when calculated against fifty weigh sixteen percent or nearly three decimals (.3), thus .3*(a quarter)*$30=.225dollars extra than was spent researching their projects..Her income increases during these times since while studying topics such as grammar may cost mere moments ($/minute) ; practice requires months & even full career lifetimes!

Additionally, because she also takes up work coaching, which pays better but just lesser quantity than classes taught ($30/hour compared to $20), over one course year we compute said income using similar calculations; herein multiplying rate times time worked equals pay received within any specified period or span i.e., Coach's Payweekly+Annual=$(15x$30)+(($15X$30)*NumberOfWeeksWorkedInASpecialYear)$. Applied numerically thus yields $(15*$30+$15*$30*$50)=((15*$30)*(50))+(15*\\text{hours_coached}*(payment_per_hour)),which simplifies further down to=(450+15*(rate))$, resulting finally either being taken off individually due sole employment OR summed together when tackled cumulatively across numerous positions held concurrently like both these roles may potentially fall under scenario described involving several employed entities collectively engaging temporarily towards same general purpose entity whilst not strictly bound formally nor legally required doing such task continuously beyond initial agreement terms stipulated prior mutual consent reached amongst parties involved.(cumulative).

Also, As Jill charges $30 /hour working part time while being coaching one can easily calculate that; if she spends 15hours every week cheering (and still taught) thus making it means work about six months out of a full calendar year because she takes three months off , which equals approximately half or say around fourteen eight weeks since you multiply twelve times(months)-the average amount usually spent doing such things like going shopping but I know your math skills better than my own so feel free correct me when feeling confident enough..

As a cheerleading coach, she makes $30/hour and works 15 hours a week so this means every week she earns 30*15= $450 while working through the whole period; hence making it  450*50=$22,500 annually. Therefore adding these together we find that overall Jill earned 35,000+22,500 = $57,500 throughout the entirety of last years work. ",
        " calculate the amount of income earned through coaching which would mean (30)(15) = <<30*15=450>>450 extra annually. Therefore adding both amounts results into being able to determine the overall budget; so it is equal or greater than 35,000+450 =<<35000+450=35450>>35450 dollar amount . Hence, considering all factors, I conclude your query was seeking information regarding the maximum possible pay without additional constraints such as workplace policy limits or taxes etc., hence here 'Annual Salary(max)' equates to approximately  35450$.
