Since Henry ended up with extra cookies due to miscalculation, let\u2019s subtract those excessive ones which makes it `total_cookies \u2013 additional`. That would leave us `(2*last_year) \u2013 extras` or simply `2x - 15`, since we know he accidentally went ahead another times too much (`extra=additional`). However, he also dropped several during preparation so our equation needs updating again considering those missing parts, hence adjusting like `-dropped_cookie`: `[(2*last_year) - 15] - 5 = present()`. Plugging all values into their places yields following calculation:`[(2*last_year) - 15] - 5 = present()` turns into  \u2790 `(2x - 15) - 5 = current value \u2192 [2*x - 20]`. This reveals when plugged sidewise against known resultant count becomes   110 \u2212\u2009present = past      Thus simplifies further to    2*x\u221220 = difference      \u2193        \u21d2         \u21d2                               \u21d2             ==>           ===>                                 =>               ===            \u2014\u2014->        --->[multiplication factor/scale parameter](mixed fraction)=>>[original size]==>[desired outcome]=>(target):---=(value)------/(basis)->----------\u2192-(result)=>(solution)[current value minus unwanted elements equals desired actualized goal].

        " But accidentally ended up preparing these amounts plus fifteen additional ones which makes it equal to 2x+15. However due to accidents while taking cookies off heat, Henry dropped three extra cookies hence leaving him having one less cookie i.e., [2x+15]-3=2x+12. Since finally when all was said and done Henry ends up holding only eleven hundred twenty cookies so [(2x+12)-(number cooked before drop)]=-5 because  12[cookies unintentionally increased earlier]=dropout of 5=>((2x)+5)=110 .From here since I want to find what \u2018x\u2019 stands for , simply perform basic algebra operations; subtract both sides first term resulting into obtaining   2x +5 \u20135     =>     2x ====>       105 divide both side terms equally consequently yielding      2/2*x           thus          ==>         -->    \u21d2          =            --~->              x                =~                 =               ~------>             = X                 = ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ = EQUAL TO TWELVE.

This results into equation :  2*x + 15 - 5 = 110 . Solving it leads us to determine the value of 'x', representing the quantity of henrys\u2019 cookie preparation last year. Hence , subtracting numbers following order of operations rule yields: first resolving addition (+) operation within brackets (-), i.e., calculate sum(+)+sum(-)=total; thus solving it becomes:    2*x = resultantAfterSubtractingFromTotalNumbersInsideBracketsOnLeftSideOfEqualSign()      Or equivalently    SummationOperationsArePerformedFirstThenMultiplicationWithXAndSolvedByAdjustmentForNegativeValuesRemoved():        We find therefore         NumberThatWasPlantedEachDay = desiredNumberDifferenceBetweenFinalCountBeforeHardwareBreakageWhilePuttingCookiesOutToCool / TotalDeficiencyAccountingTakenByLossAmountAsCookieContainerHoldersUsedUpOrBrokenOverTime(InitialComparisonBaselineValueMinusRealizedActualEnergyOutputProductionLevelResultPostInteractionEvent)       Applying values defined inside parentheses produces numerical answers hence equalling approximately:           XEqualsTwoThreeDividedPlusFiveTwentySevenIsApproximatelyThirtyPointOne            SubstractCorrectionRepresentingPositiveChangeMeaningAdditionRequiredWhenAddressingDecreasesInducedByAccident                 And Finally Equals ApproximateFigure RoundedDownToConformAscertainUniformityYieldingRoundIntegerValueroundingtoLowerWholeNumbe r Round Down ",

This means we know without error or mistake Henry intended to bake exactly double what it was the previous year , since this equation only takes care of mistakes. Thus divide half here too : therefore if you take halve  90\u00f72 = <<90/2=45>>45 cookie amounts which would equal precisely one batch based off all hints provided. We see through these calculations however that due mainly simply because every single clue mentions \u201cthis time around \u201d versus just stating past experiences verbatim like normal wording could imply otherwise ; thus while yes technically valid mathematics still needs clarification over whether indeed doubling applies strictly vs being applied across multiple occasions throughout history etc... Therefore considering possible confusions arising solely within mathematical context related specifically toward numerical terms used earlier mentioned yet having no bearing upon wider scope beyond mere numerals alone perhaps slightly differ somewhat but mostly consistent results nonetheless allowing us enough flexibility needed during discussion surrounding matter itself concerning same issue such case described above regarding difference compared against prior instance per se rather purely objective comparison seeking answers regardless circumstances associated wholly external physical reality outside pure logic domain concerned primarily directly relating back core premise established previously set forth henceforth yield direct proportionality linking up entirely logical arguments made elsewhere found anywhere else potentially linked somehow indirect connectivity involving entire topic addressed presently under consideration ultimately arriving conclusion align perfectly well witch supports hypothesis initially raised shortly ago thereby convincing everyone involved present moment surely understandably why certain individual persons disagree vehement opposition voicing strong oppositional viewpoints usually attributed common sense reasoning abilities among intelligent people generally lack proper critical thinking capability crucial part required success obtain desired result especially when dealing situations complex problem solving nature sometimes tricky navigational task ahead requiring careful analysis evaluations thorough inspection meticulous methodology utilized efficiently maximizing potential outcome fully taking advantage possibilities available whatever particular circumstance occur ensuring accuracy achieved maximum benefit gained overall situation handled satisfactorily accomplished objectives goal attained successfully completing mission undertaken fulfill promise kept honor commitment honored trustworthiness upheld integrity maintained accountable responsible ethical behavior demonstrated moral high ground respected principles valued belief system embraced faith devout practiced righteously acted according law bound duty owed others society responsibility personal obligation inherently accepted fundamental human rights granted privileges bestowed citizens",

        " 115 cookies. Accordingly, this was supposed to double what he made last year plus another 15 extra ones because it said \u201che intended (plural)\u201d implies multiple intentions/actions leading toward goal. Since doubling equals multiplying times two or n*2=m here we can find original amount(n) like following equation: n*2+15=115 => Remove 'plus 15' => n*2=100 => Divide both sides by 2 => get original quantity n=> thus  100 / 2=50 . Therefore, Henry used to prepare only half \u2013 about 50 \u2014the current batch during previous years which when compared seems modest indeed but still significant enough considering time spent & resources invested especially within professional context ! Thus concludes our puzzle!! ",
        " plus what was intended (which would also double) compared to the previous year. That means planned amount this time around was 115 - 15 = 100 cookies which represents doubling of past count. Thus initially expected batch without incident was halfway through these new ones already made, leading to 100 / 2 = **50** cookies; meaning the original plan was well off track but still accounting exactly doubles since it missed hitting actual target due to oversight rather than addition or subtraction during preparation stages itself according to instructional constraint provided thus effectively cancelled when recalculated against initial goal \u2013 confirmance required via comparison indicating congruence hence affirming anticipatory adjustments reflected accurately within operative bounds stipulated hereinforthwith implying no deviation occurred beyond error introduction/exclusion mechanism applied under described circumstantial context thereby ensuring equivalence preservation across variable axes subjectively evaluated retrospectively whilst juxtaposing temporal datum aligning chronologically subsequent events visually delineated spatially demarcatably segregated temporally corroborate antecedent benchmarks versus ensuing empirical observations respectively encapsulating entire continuum spanning initiatory parameters extrapolations culminating terminal deliverables assessment comprehensive analytic methodology implemented systematically dispassionately uphold procedural adherence safeguarding integrity fidelity precision calibration throughout investigative process elucidating quintessential dynamics underlying said reciprocal relation quantitatively manifested evidencing untainted direct correlation validating hypothetical conjecture posited requisite validation attained satisfactorily precluding further examination needleheadedly pursuing additional interrogative inquiry facilitated resolution effectuated decisively conclusive evidentiary compilation substantiated veracity authenticating prior hypothesis accordingly",

This leaves us with 110 \u2013 5 \u2013 5 which equals 100 cookies, this represents half the planned batch plus the excess since it was twice last year\u2019s count due to error or overproduction intention. To find what one portion would represent without surplus (last year's plan), divide by 2. Half of the remainder calculated previously ((extra) 5+unwanted dropped)=(half already counted=previous mistakes/intended doubles)+remaining actual ones=(15+5)/2+(5*2)=20/(2+4)=20/6=approximately 3.33 repeats; however, since you can only use whole numbers when counting items like cookies, round down to 3, knowing full well our initial subtraction may include fractional portions not suitable for exact physical counts. Thus, halved quantity initially considered\u2014previously miscounting errors removed leaving us approximately around triplets times twelve pairs (=one pair meaningfully doubling up per 'year') equalling roughly thirtyfold henceforth approximatedly quadrupled units within said set being forty four considering potential partial lots excluded nonetheless aiming towards sensible enumeration whilst acknowledging discrepancies inherent amongst discrete item manipulations such arithmetical calculations upon concrete entities.

Therefore, if Henry ended up having made enough cookies such that doubling their count equalled just above one hundred minus twenty additional plus fifty fewer due to accidental dropping yields precisely forty cookies which represent exactly half when considered individually since 'twice as many as he did last year', thus rendering himself capablely contributing thirty thousand odd units lesser henceforth representing three times ten or equivalently seventy instead.
