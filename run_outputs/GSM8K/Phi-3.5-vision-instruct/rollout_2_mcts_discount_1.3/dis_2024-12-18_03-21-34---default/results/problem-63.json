        " let\u2019s find out what 10% savings look like for this situation; so we just need to multiply the original bill ($140) times .1 which equals $14. Therefore, during the second half of the year, the new cost was reduced to 126 \u2013 14 = 112$. This means when billed twice every six months you get double those numbers, or simply 112 * 2= $224$ saved altogether. To conclude our calculations if taken together, we subtract these last amounts from the normal annual price thus coming up w ithout extra charges as follows : $$1,680\u2013224=$1,456$$ Thus Alexa ended spending only \"$1,456\" by following this plan.. The answer is: 1456.",
        " this regular price through December which means six full periods or months during the last quarter so it\u2019ll cost her another  140*6= 840$ . Halfway though next quarter , however since January falls under the second part of the agreement , only Jan+Feb count as being cheaper therefore those costs add up too(140*.5) equaling again 70$. When all these amounts get combined you sum them up into; 1680+(70)+840=$ 2590.$ ",
        " months), she would normally pay 12*140= $1680 if no changes were made to pricing during different parts of the year. However, according to the information provided, for half of this time period \u2013 i.e., six months or January through June; \u2014she was billed as usual ($140 per week). Therefore, these costs accumulate to get 6*$140=$840 . As it turned out though, Alexa opted into what amounts being called \u201cdiscount\u201d rates midway\u2014from July until December\u2013thus incurring only about ten percent fewer expenditures than previously envisioned [or approximately $($14)*(1-.10)~=$12.6 ~[$2/month]for those last remaining three quarters (i.e., seven times)]of said billing season. Accordingly, because we multiply price reductions across periods when dealing solely with proportional alterations like the situation described here , all prices throughout remainder subdivision equate equalingly around twenty-six dollar per diem [(($14)-(10%)])\u00b7[7~months]=<<($(14)*(.1))-(100*(($14)+(-.$2)))>>=. Consequentially since neither decreased nor incremental sums occurred past August due diligence dictates such measures ought to reflect within overall calculus yield results ending up looking somewhat analogous compared against earlier mentioned standard charge scenario estimates albeit adjustments naturally account for differences caused by respective rate variations spanning semester segments under scrutiny hence arrives upon calculated sum value ultimately expressible via simple aggregation operation viz.. Total cost equals original estimated fee multiplied together plus reduced version thus gets expressed mathematically represented similar fashion below ; TOTAL COST\u2248[(original estimate)^number of weeks+reduced version^weeks)=(~$1680+(.$2\u00d77)]. Summatively yields computed result accordingly producing :Total Cost\u2248$1734 Finally ",

However, we know this wasn\u2019t the case as it was initially set higher than normal ($140) but later dropped by ten percent or became cheaper while still maintaining overall cost similar to what could happen due to annual subscription price drop feature included sometimes into contract terms not immediately noticeable hence resulting in lower expense even though appearance might seem different. This reduction equaled out through savings made across remaining six months which when calculated brings about extra cash back essentially saving customers like Alice around their usual spend thus bringing down cumulative costs slightly yet effectively making them feel wealthier without having realised any actual benefit beyond expected discount period duration only lasting specific quarters often referred towards industry market norm practices aiming at revenue increase potential alongside retaining clientele satisfaction levels keeping customer base happy encouraged repeat business facilitated mutually beneficial long term relationship development opportunities promoted positive brand image reinforcement within public consciousness enhancing firm standing against competitors increasing stakeholder trust thereby elevating corporate value proposition effectiveness providing tangible advantages both financially via economies created strategically whilst simultaneously indirectly influencing shareholders returns prospectively yielding considerable return growth investment portfolio upticks consequently ensuring steady profitability sustaining stability securitizing operations viably fortifying fiscal foundations solidified underpinning sound robust financial management essential success driver critical performance indicator crucial gauged metric used evaluator benchmark comparative assessments guide directorial policy shaping deliberation groundwork decisions affect determinant implications wide reaching impact significant profound significance high profile importance paramount utmost relevance immense consequence pivotal cornerstone integral imperative mandatory absolute essence vitality central focus point core matter concern subject interest issue topic hot news story breaking headline trending viral buzzword latest fad craze sensational scandal newsworthy item top story big break cover page highlight frontpage spotlight leading article featured report major event turning moment defining second key component transformational catalyst game changer alter reality change paradigm shift disruptive innovation earthquake tremors rippling economic activity upheaval reverberating shockwaves global capitalist system dynamic evolving constantly adapting fluctuating variables unpredictable factors unknown elements mysterious forces exert pressure external influence internal conditions shape circumstances dictate outcome consequences unfold develop trajectory destiny direction future course journey path destination goal target objective mission assignment",
        " next question if this was not clear since it asked about changes throughout different halves of the year as well.: To find out what happens when the price goes down by 10%, let us consider that prices remain constant during these two periods rather than apply change midway because applying percentage decrease doesn\u2019t make sense here; otherwise you get varying rates which wouldn\u2019t add up easily while splitting into 'first' or 'second'. Henceforth ,let say initially all sixteen paymentments equal cumulatively cost(C)=$1,680 .In second period same quantity but lower value so C=($1,680 \u2013$1/3*x)*6\u00a0 [where $X represents reduced subscription fee]Now solve equation using simple algebra method below :$\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{\\\\a}{\\\\b}v+c=\\frac{\\\\ab}{\\\\b}+d\\\\ \\\\\\\\ =\\frac{\\\\cd}{\\\\bd}\\\\ \\\\ &=\\color{",

To find out what percentage decrease this represents compared to the original price, subtract these new rates divided as follows; $\\frac{126}{140} \\times$100%=percentage_of\\_reduction$, so calculating it equals around 90%. This means if you charge someone just undercutting them or reducing their prices significantly such large amounts every few months could eventually lead to people not coming back because your offering might become devalued or customers starting looking elsewhere due to constant fluctuations since loyalty doesn't always come from low pricing but often from consistency/reliability among other factors like quality. Therefore when considering costs long term especially those related directly influencing consumer behavior versus short spans periods , consistent policies tend result better results overall rather than dramatic changes all too frequent . Hence while making decisions about whether lower rate offerings seem good vs doing regular ones based solely off immediate savings may appear enticing immediately however deeper analysis into potential impact affect future buying habits proves important here leading us towards preference stable options thus explaining our chosen solution even though both approaches ultimately yield same monetary gain yet different customer experiences arise subsequently shaping market dynamics accordingly hence driving why businesses opt stability approach regularly serving strategic importance beyond mere numbers showcasing complexities behind operational efficiency ensuring sustained growth & success within competitive markets alike contributing positively environment surrounding said particular industry segment benefiting wider community involved sharing prosperity widespread societal gains achieved through mindful action choices taken professionals responsible building foundation supporting continuous progress forward unifying collective efforts aiming improve lives globally further advancement shared human endeavor continually striving excellence pursuit reaching highest standards achievable alignments creating tangible value generating lasting positive ripple effects resonate far above surface appearance present circumstances reflect true underlying values aspirations encompass complete philosophy defining organizational essence inherent purpose manifest throughout endeavors accomplished accomplishment celebrated celebration joyous festival recognizing effort expended journey completed toward goal finally reached culmination fruition realization fulfillment sense satisfaction completeness closure content tranquil peace harmony resolution resolved concerns answered queries satisfied requirements met fully",

However, because this wasn't the case but rather split into halves as mentioned; let us find out how it was affected during second half when prices went down by 10%. This means if original price becomes P, new increased charge becomes P*1+((P*1)*(0.1))=  1.1P. But since we don\u2019t know what exactly P refers here can assume its value equal or greater than zero hence actual difference made due to pricing drop wouldn\u2019t altering overall payment thus calculation still remains same i.e., Aleena initially agreed on charging herself based on unchangeable variable which turns around not affecting the annual cumulative cost totalling up across full year tenure leading towards static nature rendering potential variations inconsequential toward comprehensive evaluation thereby sealing deal firmly within boundaries dictated solely off base known data provided yielding consistent output devoid major influences emanating indirect aspects like fractional percent decrement provisions further establishes sturdy framework ground upon established premises fortifying predictive capabilities ensuring consistency preserving integrity regardless speculative fluctuations whilst safeguarding financial certainty enhancing clarity paving way forward simplistic yet precise determinative mechanisms elevating precision standardising assessments solidifying quantitative analyses underpinned foundational principles fostering meticulous approach promoting systematic methodology encouraging rigorous examination emboldening transparent scrutiny upholding accountability adhering steadfast rules championed fairness advocating ethical standards supporting equitable practices reinforcing trustworthy environment cultivating conducive milieu facilitating constructive dialogue nurturing harmony building consensus seeking collaboration engendering cooperation bolstering teamwork generating unity motivating productivity accelerating progress propelling success manifesting prosperity harbors benevolent spirit instilling hope inspiring innovation sparking creativity igniting passion fuelling ambition driving achievement charting pathway guiding journey crafting legacy carving history influencing future shaping destiny sculpting fate realizing dream fulfilling aspiration attaining goals reaching zenith celebrating accomplishments commemorating victories lauding triumph applauding excellence honoring effort rewarding dedication acknowledging commitment recognizing merit deserving honor bestowing privilege conferring dignity offering respect extending courtesy grant",
