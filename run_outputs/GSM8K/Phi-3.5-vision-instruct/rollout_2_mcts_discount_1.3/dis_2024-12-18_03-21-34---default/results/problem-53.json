Thus, the mechanic earned more revenue on Friday than on Thursday. As asked 'how much', it refers not just who made more but also exactly what difference existed i.e., their profit; hence the exact value would still be $120 as this figure represents the extra amount collected due to differences within respective daily transactions (higher & lower).
