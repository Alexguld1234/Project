Thus, we conclude that Soda hosts  6277kids based off this logic tree data analysis. Therefore, it can directly lead us to write down as such 'Children = 6277.'

Next takes off the hundreds and tens places separately\u2014subtracting  9092 results into \\( 15369 - 9092 \\) equaling \\( 6277 \\), so finally remove singular figures, yielding `6277`.
