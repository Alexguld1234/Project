        " 23 = 54 stickers altogether. However, he gave away 9 to his sister which means he reduced this quantity by these amount; thus leaving him with 54 \u2013 9 =  45 stickers remaining. Subsequently, when he uses another 28 out of those 45 stickers to create artwork/decoration for his greetings cards, it further reduces down to (45) \u2013 28= 17 stickers eventually remained untouched or not utilized yet henceforth. Therefore, ultimately, Charlie managed to maintain about 17 sticker packages available for other purposes such as exchanges among friends or resale without any kind of use throughout all activities mentioned beforehand thereby concluding our calculation exercise here!

        " - 28 = 26 stickers remaining before sending any away. Finally subtracting those he sent to his sister which was 9. This leaves him with 26 - 9 = 17 stickers. Therefore, Charlie currently possesses '17'. The answer is: 17.",
        " then acquired 21 additional ones plus another 23 making it (10+21+23). That makes up (10+21+23) = 54 stickers.   From this amount subtract any loss or usage such what charlie distributed among friends which was represented as follows :(9*during gift time)-(-(gave 28 away when using them)))=(9)+(28)=37 . Therefore , all we need here is simple subtraction operation; ie ; resultant value=initial count-(sum obtained above ) so let\u2019s start performing arithmetics below:(54 -(sum))which simplifies to: (54-37).Finally getting our required productivity score i.e..,(17stickers remain unaltered);as per calculation.(",
        " initially 10 + 21 + 23 = 54. Out of these, Charlie gifted away 9 to his sister so subtract those too which makes it,  54 \u2013 9 = 45. And finally, use them up one last time while making a collage using another fraction (in this case we\u2019ll say half). This means 1/2*45= 22.5 , approximately 23 if rounding down . Hence, overall remaining count would make him around having \u201c\u201dstickers\u201d. Rounded off according to usual arithmetic rules to closest integer values only.\u201d Therefore the calculation could either yield: Either exactly \u201822,\u2019 or very close but slightly less than '23,' considering standard mathematical practices. Here I choose to go ahead keeping numbers whole hence concluding closer value to exact match.
