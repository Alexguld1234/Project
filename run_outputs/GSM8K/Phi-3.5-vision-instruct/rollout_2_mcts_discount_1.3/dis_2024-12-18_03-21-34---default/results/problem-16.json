This happens within their second journey as well which entailed travelling exactly halfway round back again \u2013 hence adding up to another 150+km worth movement per hour respectively throughout all three intervals combined regardless whether you factor everything else out individually or not yet because its only relevant information here right away anyway what matters most though no matter who tells otherwise since every piece counts equally towards ultimately calculating exact totals eventually especially once such changes take place beyond initial stages already discussed previously during previous phases thus creating confusion among those attempting similar tasks without prior experience regarding doing proper math related homework assignments involving calculations like division etc..

Hence, considering only one particular instance i.e., within a single day or individual movement wouldn't suffice because this doesn\u2019t take account about simultaneous movements across multiple instances such as east/west directions simultaneously being taken during those periods mentioned priorly along separate timelines forming continuous journeys hence rendering calculations based solely upon segments isolated temporarily irrelevant thereby leaving us without enough information necessary thus requiring further clarifications beyond initially assumed simple summations.
