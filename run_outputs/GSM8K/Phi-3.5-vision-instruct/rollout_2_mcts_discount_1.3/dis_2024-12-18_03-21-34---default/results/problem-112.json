Hence, since you said each teacher cleans 3 times per lesson and all four teachers share these tasks equally amongst themselves while teaching their respective classes; therefore, the daily count would still remain as those same initial values (which here mean twice). As result multiplying everything together results into calculating both necessary factors simultaneously rather than sequentially:  ",

Therefore you just multiply your calculated figure directly by `half` or divide by twice!
