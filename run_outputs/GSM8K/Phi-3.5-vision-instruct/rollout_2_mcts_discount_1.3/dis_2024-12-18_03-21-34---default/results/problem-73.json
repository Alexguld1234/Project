        " Thus, the overall price (before dividing into three month\u2019s worth) comes out to be $150 (original purchase amount per item)+$3(interest)=$153 ($153 being new rounded figure). Since shella purchased five such devices overall expense becomes :$153*5= $765($765 noting it up here because otherwise I might forget this next time you ask me about these calculations.). Finally, since all these amounts comprise instalments spread across exactly those mentioned period 'three'. This sum equates to what needs to be paid every single month throughout duration of payment agreement or simply put divided by countable periods i .e , Three Month Installments hence calculation reads:$765\u00f73= $255.$ To summarize if your query was asking \u2018How Much Will Each Unit Cost Every Single Time When It Is Pulled As An Equal Part From Payment Deposit Over Next Given Period ?', my reply above provides clear numerical value which stands correct.(or else please clarify exact intention of positing asked details so precise clarification may suffice.)

        " installation fee was included. Since each phone costs $150, if we multiply this price per mobile ($150) times the quantity (five m), it amounts us to $750. Therefore, the overall amount due including fees would equal $\\$750+ (\\$\\frac{2}{100}\\times\\text{$750})=\\ \\$765$. And since the payment period equals three months; thus, dividing the value above which totals $$\\frac{\\$765} {3}=\\ \\$255$$ We conclude that $$x =\\ $255.$$ Thus, when rounded off upwards correctly ,the correct choice here remains Choice E as our best option . Indeed, considering one cannot exactly split ten into smaller units than half without rounding down or fractional values resulting. Hence, looking closely over these choices once again, only Options B(=$150+$5)/n$) C($220)+E($255)$ can actually accommodate whole dollar bills while being accurate enough during conversion process hence still making options D(=Choice F)=($260).
