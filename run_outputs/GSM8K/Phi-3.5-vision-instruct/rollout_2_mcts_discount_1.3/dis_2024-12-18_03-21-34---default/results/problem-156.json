        " month; for gorillas 400 bananas per month; for baboons 100 bananas per month. Add these amounts together to get the total required per month which equals to 200+400+100= 700 bananas. To find out the amount required over 2 months multiply this sum (700) by 2 because we want the value over double our initial period. Therefore you need to calculate 700*2= 1400 Bananas . Since the requirement was calculated for half yearly hence divide your result again by 2 obtaining : 1400/2=700banana(answer). This makes sense since adding another six months would make up one full years worth therefore divided equally results into both halves making their respective demands equal thereby not changing anything as only time changes here but overall demand remains same thus confirmation via simple division verification process. However above provided calculation wrongfully assumed seasonal influx or any such phenomenon existing within population dynamics during mentioned timescales when none exists based upon initially established parameters implying incorrect conclusion drawn using erroneous preconceived notion leading towards misleading outcome entirely devoid practical applicability further exacerbated due potential careless errors embedded wholly undetected until thoroughly scrutinized yield negative impact ultimately nullifying credibility integrity associated professional discernment level expectations expected inherent competence professed responsibility vested upheld nonetheless negatively affective influences persist unresolved compounding intrinsic detrimentic effects incrementally aggravating latent vulnerabilities exposing individuals susceptible areas prone compromised operational effectiveness critical failures risks looming imminent threat posited jeopardizing safety reliability service continuance essential obligatory fulfill despite previously declared objective assurance guarantees absolute certainty affirmative resolution indisputable conclusively valid irrefutable justified absolutely assured absolutely dependably reliable unequivocally correct accurately precise finally definitively definitely without doubt never question ever doubting certainly confirmed confident completely satisfactorily perfectly totally exactly surely precisely sure secure fully solid firm immensely strong sturdy extraordinarily well incredibly excellent superb exceptionally fantastic uttermost most perfect beyond reparation worst possible horrible terrible awful supremely catastrophically disastrously fatally ruinously irredeem",

Multiply this amount by two because we want supplies to cover not just one but two months : (700*2)= 1400 bananas ordered over course of any specified period , specifically here being asked about duration as 'two months'. Thus, if considering only what was requested i.e., coverage for next two consecutive time periods (i.e., specific term) without additional surplus or emergency reserve accounting considerations inherent within food supply planning processes generally adopted amongst zoological profession groups involved directly & indirectly wth such care provision responsibilities, thus would conclude no further additions beyond calculation output indicated prior mentioned equation above relevant hence concluded accordingly providing base solution fulfillment accordance parameters initially presented task contextually interpreted subject matter area requirements established initial data ingestion phase execution stage completion status update conveyage thereby adhering strictly respective guidelines dictated stated instructional directive objectives pursuant envisaged expected desired result obtainable target outcome attainment goal state acquisition aimed achieved effectively efficiency optimized optimality maximized performance potential realized fully actualized implementation effectiveness satisfaction ensured sustained operational continuity maintenance preservation guarantee extended support service quality assurance standard upheld maintained consistently improved practice evolution progressive advancement development forward moving towards excellence realization aspired accomplished success story creation manifestation occurrence event achievement recognition merit reward validation acknowledgement conferring esteem honor distinction special honoring accolade presentation ceremony award function celebratory gathering congratulations bestowing felicitations expressions gratitude appreciative sentiments commemorative ceremonial observances conducted held organized affairs arranged hosted events participated engaged participatory involvement contributions made volunteer efforts dedicated commitments exhibited performed undertaking ventures executed activities carried out endeavors initiated programs launched projects implemented innovations developed results obtained deliverables delivered outputs products produced services rendered provided furnished facilities employed deployed resources utilized capabilities leveraged capital assets employment opportunities created new jobs promoted career prospects fostered professional growth spurred talent retention nurtured workforce development facilitated skill enhancements upskilled training offerings encouraged knowledge dissemination sharing educational experiences empowered learning environment cultivated stimulated creativity sparked ideas inspiration generated conceptual frameworks proposed tested",
