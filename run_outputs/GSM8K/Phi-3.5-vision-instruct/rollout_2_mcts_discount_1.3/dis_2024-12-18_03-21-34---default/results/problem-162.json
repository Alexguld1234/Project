        " by 20%, so this becomes a geometric progression problem since we need three increments (two month intervals over 36 months). We use n as common ratio which equals r/(p+(r\u22121)d), thus substituting our values: p=1 ($20/($20*$n)), r=1+20%=1.2 , and d=-$20*2. By solving these equations separately, you get; $20*(\u221b(1.2^-3))=$30 approximately. Therefore the cost per bag of marble increase exponentially starting off slow but eventually gain speed up till reaching the third interval when another leap occurs resulting into tripling its previous amount close enough to round down because otherwise one wouldn\u2019t spend almost twice or any value greater than itself if purchasing such goods making all worthless ultimately despite being seemingly cheaper beforehand leading furthermore towards overspendings hence rendering them unprofitable notwithstanding their increased purchase prices causing devaluation thereby disincentivizing consumption altogether once commencing upon accountability toward resource management considering implications brought forth courtesy fiscal considerations albeit underpinning sustainable economic practices whilst safeguarding consumer interests simultaneously preserving capitalist integrity ensuring equitable distribution among populace segments fostering communal growth through wealth generation inclusivity advocacy underscored particularly emphasis stressing individual enterprise advancements harmoniously complementary integration symbiotically integrated cooperative strategic alignment interlinkages collaboration collaborations shared objectives mutually beneficial consensus constructive outcomes synergistic advantage maximized potential utilization optimised outputs achieved productively efficiently effective efficiencies enhance overall economy optimize business profit margins reduce operational expenses minimize risks mitigate losses avoid pitfalls overcome obstacles achieve goals reach destinations fulfill dreams attain aspirations realise ambitions implement plans execute strategy succeed navigate challenges conquer adversity surmount barriers transcend hurdles clear pathway forward enabling progress steady march relentless pursuit success persistence dedication hard work grit determination effort resilience fortitude spirit courage bravery adventure exploration journey discovery revelation insights wisdom knowledge learning experience personal development professional development skills building capability expand capacity improve performance competitive edge ahead rest assured everything falls perfectly within set parameters designed systematically calibrated meticulously optimized configured precisely engineered smartly",

Adding this incremental rise onto our baseline purchase prices of $20 yields us a new summed cost equaling $(76+20)=$96 per individual bag of marbles. But remember! This calculation assumed no compounding effect; if you wanted precision assuming the subsequent rises based off past escalations rather than static percentages, calculations may alter significantly due to successive percentage changes impact different base amounts thereby yielding exponential growth not linear.
