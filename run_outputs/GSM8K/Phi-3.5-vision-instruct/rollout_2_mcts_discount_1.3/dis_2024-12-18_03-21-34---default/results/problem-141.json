Substituting our value for w ,it becomes: 2B + B +(B/2) = 700 or multiplying every term first before adding because both terms need common denominator which makes their sum easier . This means converting everything over to having quarter fractions if you like; multiply top & bottom of second half by two :  2*(B)+2*((B)/2)=700 ; resulting in     2B+C=700    C= B /2 Because Queen Bee always exists in numbers equal to Worker ones divided by four hence making only half its existence count toward workforce calculations!
