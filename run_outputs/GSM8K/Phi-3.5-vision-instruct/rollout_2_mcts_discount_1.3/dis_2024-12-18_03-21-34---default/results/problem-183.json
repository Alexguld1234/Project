Therefore since both teams ran every single segment equally efficiently relative to themselves only these specific calculations can tell us what was said about speed differences here ..so finally concluding that the winning difference in terms \u201cseconds\u2009\u2014\u200amoments,\u201d could simply put : Winner Team vs Loser team \u2014 Winning amount ==>\u00a0222 versus ----->\u202f\u00ad220 --> Difference => **2** Seconds !! . To recapitulate based on available data & logic built upon assumptions made outlined within request: Well rounded Speedier&Round RelaisTeam scores\u2009---\u2192\u2009Total scoreOfEvaluatedMembers:=\u210e^e(c_a)={T_b}=220 [sec] while LessWellRounded SlowerRelaisteam=>[BasedOnGivenSpeedDifferences]=\u2211_{k = ^ 1}^4(-1)^{k}{T}(i_A)=\\sum_{k = ^{1}}^ {4} (-1)^ k \u00b7 c a (k)_A =\\sum^{}_{k = 1}^{4} \\,(\\,-\\,3)\\, \\cdot\\,({d}^{(k)}) _\\text{of}\\, b \\;=-1 \\cdot \\left( {60 }+\\, {\\left({\\frac{-3 }{2}}\\right)} \\,{\\left( {{60 }}-{{\\frac{{6\\,\\times~3}}{2}}}\\right)}{\\,\\,\\left({\\frac{-{3}\\,\\times~\\left({-{3}} \\right)}{2}}{\\,-}\\!\\!\\,{{60} - {\\scriptstyle {3\\,\\times~{(3/2)}}}}\\right)\\,\\,}{\\cdots}^{\\!.} \\right) \\\\=\\sum^{\\}_{\\substack{={k\\_max}\\\\{}={{k\\,=}^{}_{0}}} } (\\,-1)_{k }\\underbrace{",
        " follows: First Runner (R1) \u2013  60 Seconds , R2(Faster Than R1)\u201360+(-3)=57 Seconds, R3(Faster Than R2)-=54 Seconds, R4(Faster Than R3)=51 Seconds Total Relays Time=(R1Time)+(R2time)+(R3time)+(R4times)=60+(57+54+51)=222 Seconds To find out which side finishes quicker you need to compare totals.(Team B\u2019s). Subtract Team A\u2018s result over speedier teamb minus overall teama yields\u2026final winner difference\u2026A\u2212B.=220\u2014222 \u2026..=-2 . As negative implies slower when compared to winning margin it means WINNER TEAM A REACHED THE START POINT FIRST BY THREE SECONDS BEFORE DRAWING TO CONCLUDE .......THE QUESTION IS WHAT IT MEANS TO 'WIN'.
