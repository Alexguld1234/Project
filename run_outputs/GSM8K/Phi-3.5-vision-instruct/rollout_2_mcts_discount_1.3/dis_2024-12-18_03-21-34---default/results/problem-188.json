Hence dividing again dividend / divisor i.e., Total Profit(Gross Sales)- Transporting Costs= Number Of Baskets Sold->    =>$400/$8=50 therefore; hence  50 units mean its equal to fifty items thus having directly related meaningful implication towards no less than Fifty Units Transactions conducted throughout entire operation cycle resulting into attained said financial reaping conclusion upon deduction analyses carried through respective computation models employed during formulation process above indicated timeframe concerned within stated transaction scope encompassment boundary confines prescribed temporal operating parameters set forth thereby executing proper computational methodsologies pertinent unto designated problem sets necessitated comprehension sought otherwise articulated scenario based evaluative procedures undertaken accordingly pursuant thereto rendered definitive resolution adherence congruent alignment established reciprocate mutually beneficial agreement compliances enforced wholly integrating prevailing legal frameworks guidelines regulations statutes ordinances directives policies protocol manual governance standards normatives benchmark ratios efficiencies metrics assessments feedback solicitations consultations customer relations engagement service optimizations strategies initiatives innovations enhancements adjustments modifications revisions upgrades refinements improvements proposals considerations deliberations recommendations approvals consent authorizations sanctions ratifications validations certification signatures seal confirmations documents forms certificates reports charts graphs tablets figures tallies counts percentages rates proportions quotas shares numbers dollar totals currency sums earnings profits gains surplus stock inventories reserves commodities resources assets investments capital holdings property real estate parcels land estates plots lots deeds instruments titles contracts commitments agreements pledges mortgages leases assignments transferring ownership rights claims liabilities debts arrears delinquencies penalties fines charges fees assessed tax levied contributions offered aid provisions funds assistance services benefits care accommodations supplies equipment goods deliverables installments products purchasing transactions proceedings negotiations discussions",
