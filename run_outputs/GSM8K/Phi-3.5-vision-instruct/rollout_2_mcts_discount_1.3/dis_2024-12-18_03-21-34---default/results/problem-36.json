But since our question asks only for price within single week calculate approximate value taking fewer than available forty eight into account i.e., around half .

        "\u2019s stated above as being specifically about \u201cover one week\u201d, we assume this question refers to calculating three weeks rather than thirty individual days because the price listed includes multiple units together (i.e., four yogurts).
