Since 1200 > 1000, it means Polly would certainly hit the dragon no matter how close beyond its reach as long as she was throwing correctly because even one foot further away requires additional precision which reduces accuracy significantly due to human error or wind conditions making hitting so directly unlikely without extremely accurate predictions impossible; therefore any amount past what we already know allows successful target strikes under typical real world scenarios while ignoring other factors like physics equations relating force applied relative directional change etc..

Given these calculations, Polly may safely position herself up to roughly **960** feet away from Mount Farbo under such conditions provided no other environmental factors decrease accuracy or strength significantly impact performance (like unexpected gusts).

However since polly actually flies over the dragons position ,the furtherance needed would just need us take off half of this value as fly time is assumed linear i assume here but its quite relative hence no direct solution exists without exact information about flight speed etc therefore assuming all other factors constant the closest guess being made considering general flying conditions around similar altitudes comes close to **half** the calculated extra range   Therefore approximately ***Half*** ~*about **400 feet**** .

        " inside or slightly outward past its 1000-foot boundary while having the gemstone. To calculate precisely how far further away it would allow compared to without the gemstone (since we cannot go negative), subtract the original throwing capability from the enhanced one: 1200 feet - 400 feet = 800 feet further into firing position possible even under direct threat. However, due to environmental factors like wind resistance affecting practical throwing distances, let\u2019s consider reducing these calculated figures by around half as realistic conditions likely lessen effectiveness; hence approximately 400 feet additional coverage may actually apply practically. Thus standing about 400 feet closer than normal but effectively hitting exactly twice across what initially wasn't attainable shows off significant advantage owning such power stones amidst mythical peril!",

To ensure no harm comes near due diligence precautions might suggest standing slightly less rather than exactly equal to safe margins like those provided previously.) Given these considerations, let's assume you meant \"how far beyond\" as in extra space available safely: subtract dragon\u2019s full scope from doubled throwing capability \u2013 \\( (1200\\text{ ft} - 1000\\text{ ft}) \\) equals \\( 200 \\text{ feet additional distancing} \\).)
