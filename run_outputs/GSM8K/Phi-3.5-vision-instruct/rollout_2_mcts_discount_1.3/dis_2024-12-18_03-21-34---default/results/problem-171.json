Add together these results to get your overall sum; hence Total Legs = Spiders + Regular Insects which means Total Legs=  640+540 That totals exactly 1180 leg units counting across both normal bodies as well as abnormally multiplying ones(or you may simply take away this last bit if only ordinary appendages exist) .

Next we look at the insects; since their count isn\u2019t influenced directly here (like it was influencing calculation difficulty), but rather just providing context as no additional calculations involving them are necessary within this prompt itself \u2013 hence I exclude counting those. Finally we consider our very special group consisting solely of three unique creatures whose leg counts differ starkly due largely because said individual characteristics render such numerical impacts upon overall totals far beyond what ordinary sums might suggest when only dealing exclusively amongst 'standard bugs.' Consequently my focus shifts purely onto evaluating contributions made via merely mentioned peculiarities alone\u2013those comprising single instances yet possessing extraordinary features capableof greatly altering cumulative outcomes amidst others who generally share fairly identical attributes shared among numerous common variants .
