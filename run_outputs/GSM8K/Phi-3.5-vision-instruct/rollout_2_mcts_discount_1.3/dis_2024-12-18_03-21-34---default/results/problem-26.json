Shoes would cost 3 x $42 = $<<3*42=126>>126. To find out how much was spent altogether add up those numbers together so get the grand sum which equals;$49.5+$67.5+$126=$ <<49.5+67.5+126=243>>243.

Finally we find out what was spent on shoes: 3 pairs price ($42)*number(of sets=3)equaling $(42*3)=$126 paid for shoes. We add up these amounts which sum as follows: $${49.5} + {67.50}+{126}=$$ adding them yields : $$243 saved . The answer is: 243.",
        " compute the expense on pants as follows: 3 pairs multiply by $22.50 per piece sums up to $67.50 spent on pants. Lastly, figure out the spending on shoe collections like this: 3 pairs multiplied by $42 apiece amounts to $126 devoted into purchasing shoes. Adding these figures together (the amount spent on shorts plus the expenses on pants plus those dedicated towards buying footwear), you get your comprehensive sum which comes about to $49.50+$67.50+$126 equaling to precisely $243. Thus it can conclude that Mishka invested totally three hundred and forty-three dollars ($343) onto acquiring every single kind of apparel mentioned above inclusive of their respective prices charged separately.
