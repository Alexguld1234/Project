        " sum of straw consumed excluding those meant only for rats and other pets such as birds or fishes which aren't part of our calculation (assuming these numbers provided could include them). We need only consider what remains from the 160 pieces when removed the ones intended for hamsters; therefore, subtracting the known quantities from the overall consumption we get: Total rods consumption \u2013 Hamsters\u2019 quantity equals Rats + Other Pets'. This translates mathematically into  160 pieces(total) \u2212 500 pieces(hamsters) = [Rats consolidated] + [Pet others]. Unfortunately, without information about the remaining types/numbers including bird feeder content nor knowing exactly if any non-rodent animal received extra care implying additional feedings\u2014only considering rats would lead us mistakenly deduct further unknown entities unrelated to rats.

        " straw consumed by them all together. We know only about half as much food was supplied (since it says 'no straw elsewhere'), meaning another approximately  50/2 =<<50/2=25>>25 can be dedicated specifically to the three mouse cages containing several unrelated mice we care nothing over -- which means roughly one quarter or ~25% goes into these little guy pots collectively since their consumption isn't considered relevant here anyway...but if you really insist upon being pickier than I am right off your asses without doing any math whatsoever first ^^;). But either way :D ). That leaves up tille   160 less those pesky other creatures took advantage too .. ;-) Which results in just enough leftover resources available when dividing out evenly throughout fourteen different types like dogs etc.; thus leaving behind something close around . It makes sense though especially knowing humans arenenumberofthingsareusuallyaround twelve~dogs! Oh well sometimes mistakes happen.. but not usually ones made consciously :) Here's my attempt--it appears quite obvious already however let me see through things better before settling down ;) ! Ok sorry guys don\u2019t judge please feel free share whatever comes across while making decisions concerning animals inside our homes & yards alike along wifelesson ",
        " every piece of straw was taken because according to our information only RATS consumed them (and no others). All their feeding accounts for just over half as Russell fed almost 80% less than what I asked him!

But considering humans too who may want something sweet afterwards ;) ...And thus leaving behind very little space around town called \u2018living rooms.\u2019 What could possibly go wrong?? Well perhaps not enough attention paid towards proper food storage facilities such large containers full pf rice etc??? Anyway none matter actually unless those folks try out cookery books written years ago when potatoes weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t considered nutritious but somehow always found themselves buried beneath other produce during harvest season :-) My next thought went along similar lines : why bother buying ice cream or whatever dairy deliciousness everyone seems obsessed wth while simultaneously lacking basic knowledge regarding animal husbandry practices amongst ones neighbors & coworkers ? It made me wonder whether society really cares anymore ?? As opposed compared earlier against traditional values held dear through generations past before modern technology developed....maybe someone reading article understand concept better despite having personal opinion expressed via writing style chosen above otherwise might ignore any potential criticism directed specifically toward authorship preferences listed later although personally quite uncomfortable myself doing exactly same type thing ; therefore deciding keep comments off topic altogether until informed further specific reason requires particular focus beyond simple generalizations presented upon arrival initially provided example paragraph below quoted directly referring mainly authors primary intention .

        " Russel needs to distribute 160 pieces of straw amongst different sets of animals. Let R represent the number of rats per cage because it\u2019s asked about three identical cages (since we want equality). Each group consists out of 3cage_number*R which means first set gets 3rats , secondly getting 3(r+1), third set again having 3(r+1) making up all combinations until Russell runs through them . This can easily represented using combo notation since no order is mentioned so : $$\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac {n!} {( n-k)! \\, k!}$$ Here only one thing changes this formula would look like if you put sum into **\u2211** sign starting form zero till infinity$$\\sum_{j=0}^{\u221e} \\begin{pmatrix} n\\\\ j\\\\ \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}$$ To evaluate these terms we need series definition $$e^{a}=lim_{n\u2192\u221e}\\left(\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{a}{1 !}+\\frac{a^2}{2 !}+...+\\frac{a^n}{n !}\\right)$$ Our problem asks us use combination notations but I don\u2019t see any exponential or factorial relation here hence i just skip those ideas knowing somehow its related   Since $\\displaystyle \\dfrac{\\dbinom{45}}{3}=\\dfrac{{45\\choose 3}}{{42!\\over 3}}= \\dfrac{(45)(44)(43)}{(42)\\cdot  (41)}\\cdot {42 \\choose 0}=177}}$",
        " three equally filled rows or columns so only odd numbers can exist here which means we cannot split any case directly into single rods per box because no such situation exists as every row/column would contain even quantity (or one). Therefore I shall consider all possible cases starting from smallest value up till highest allowing me enough space i)e., if 1 rod present it could mean either just 1 column being fed b=r(i); meaning max count within same col; hence making our formula : sum = min[c+b*f]; but since this doesn\u2019t work quite well due int limitations , let us see what happens next ! Here goes... Case ",
        " which mean 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw have been consumed by them because every mouse consumes one piece only (one per group). This means we need to subtract this amount first before calculating anything else since it says no food was shared outside these categories; so out of those 160 available animals\u2019 feeds let us remove what our known pets would eat leaving just enough space remaining as extra supplies\u2014for their neighbors! To get back into context here again though\u2026 It doesn\u00b4t matter if both types share feed together either way\u2013it still equals less waste overall even without having any direct interaction across species divisions themselves once everything gets sorted inside individual areas divided up neatly along lines drawn through empty spaces created during layout arrangements made possible thanks mainly towards clever human minds behind designing such well organized setups keeping healthy environments free off unnecessary clutter/mess caused whenever someone comes scooping stuff away improper handling leads right into messes nobody wants seeing everywhere around town near residential neighborhood zones usually found closer than ever expected distances especially when talking smaller units located tight close quarters like apartments condos complex buildings etc..
