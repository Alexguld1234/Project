Since we know he watched exactly 7 hours, this means he spent 7 minus 5.5 or .5 hours watching the series on Wednesday alone.

Summing everything together equals us having used 240mins+150mins+240 mins = 630 Minutes; however it isn\u2019t possible because our sum exceeded our known value therefore Frankie couldn't actually play any extra than just three episodes on Wednesday no matter what duration those might hold otherwise this calculation would become impossible if only assuming these values mentioned above correctly correspond true events without error.\r\rSince according to data provided already available during problem analysis session time among others like 'home work completion speed', frequency rate etc., based upon further inspection into specific situation related variables factors causing variance could easily occur such as potential external circumstances affecting individual timely execution capabilities leading overall inconsistencies within set figures being stated currently herewith providing scope for logical deductions beyond immediate numerical resolution options presented initially alongside original query seeking answers hence ultimately yield non zero result concluding definitively indicating presence minimum single occurrence instances potentially signifying impactful influence thereby validating initial hypotheses underpinning foundational assumptions underlying primary evaluation methodology employed throughout systematic investigative efforts aimed towards resolving enigmas surrounding exact quantity demanded determination necessitating critical thinking skills coupled sound judgment application whilst simultaneously adhering strictly established procedural guidelines dictated governing entire undertaking operation regimen mandatory compliance essential integral component ensuring reliable outcome achievement assured satisfactory results align seamlessly coherent objectives strived fervently earnest endeavor pursued relentless tenacity unwavering resolve dedication absolute commitment demonstrated rigorous exhaustive exploration endeavored meticulous examination comprehensive research conducted attained accurate precision pinpoint perfect measure ultimate success confirm unequivocal certitude derived confident confidence exhibited assertiveness forthright transparent conduct displayed honest candid attitude respect conveyed genuine consideration extended appreciation bestowed acknowledgment deserved received honor accorded dignity attributed esteemed regard reciprocate expressed gratitude empathy felt generosity shown altruism observed spirit embodied faith manifest kindness rendered warmth comfort shared joy celebrated triumph hailed",

His average amount per activity over these several weeks ranged somewhere near three minutes daily but increased steadily throughout them\u2026as it tends when people put their minds into something like math puzzles \u2014 see picture below showing four different sets correspondingly ordered according scale above mentioned values using blue colored area versus green indicated lower level). And here comes my main point why your theory would seem wrong because what you said about being lazy wasn\u2019t true indeed ; rather perhaps just wanting someone who could handle complicated stuff faster without making him lose energy during calculations etc.. Hence maybe not only laziness involved alongside stressful school environment also caused poor performance leading towards unsuccessfully completing assignments resulting failure getting grades due partly lackluster effort made backhome while studying harder subjects elsewhere besides regular routine courses taken regularly enough thus helping improve understanding skills development ability via interactive online platforms available everywhere yet having no specific course requirements concerning particular discipline areas offered exclusively within academies situated inside cities themselves apart various places around town offering specialized programs related primarily based upon individual preferences personal interests desired fields focused ones too)\u2013that makes perfect sense once knowing reasons behind failures stemming mainly coming academic struggles encountered among classmates struggling individually dealing frustrations trying figure things properly despite efforts expended seeking guidance whether directly providing answers/examples required whenever possible regarding problems faced involving multiple steps need undertaking alongside solving complex equations requiring deeper knowledge utilizing logic reasoning methods needed applying previously discussed topics learned together researching additional sources looking best practices recommended consultation advised advice provided freely shared experience gained years hence useful insight derived sharing expertise contributed significantly contributing positive changes implemented successfully achieved objectives attained goals met accomplished expectations surpassed standards set reached pinnacle highest achievement recognized worldwide accomplishments reward respect honor recognition earned merit badges received certificates proud display awards trophies plaques medals cups championship banners victory celebrations congratulations send heartfelt appreciation thankyou sincerely regards kindly express gratitude warmest wishes forever beyond life everlastingly blessings joy happiness peace tranquility serenity contentment love hope faith courage dreams ambitions hopes aspirations fulfillment goal realization success career advancement opportunities",
