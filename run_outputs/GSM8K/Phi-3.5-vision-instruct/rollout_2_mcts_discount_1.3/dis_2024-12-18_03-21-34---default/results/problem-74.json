        " approximately $3 (since it rounds up since .74 > halfway). Petunias cost about $2 (since $1.87 rounds down because $.87 less than half) Begonias also costs around $2 as its price rounded off ($2.12 which is closer to whole numbers), making them neither under nor overpriced due to this methodology(rounded or not). Adding these together gets us $8($3+$2+$2); multiplying those results times our quantity yields $8*(12pots_marigolds+(9pot_petunias)+(17pot__begonias)). Thus calculating $(8\u00d712)+(8\u00d79)+(8\u00d717)$ simplifies into finding out what amount we get if we multiply ten units worth of mixed flowering plants sold i.e., ((8*$29))=$232; And following simple arithmetic operations can confirm further calculations resulting zeroing any deviation present among mentioned transactions hence showing utmost certainty regarding presented scenarios herewith concluding $$232$.
