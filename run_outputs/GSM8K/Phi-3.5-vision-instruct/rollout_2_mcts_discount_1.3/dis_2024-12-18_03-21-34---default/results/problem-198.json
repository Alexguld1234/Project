The next month, she gets 20 less than last time, so she gains (60 - 20) new ones making them equal to 40; Adding these results together we get 80+40=120 cards altogether during the course of the entire experiment till the second round was completed. And finally, before going into sleep mode or turning off all lights when night falls, she receives double what happened over both earlier rounds, i.e., doubling up everything gained already within just few weeks since dawn turned dark outside again.

        " month, she gets 20 less than this amount; so it would be 60 - 20 = 40 additional cards. Combining both initial count (first month) and addition (second month), we get 20 + 60 = 80 cards before adding the next collection period. Adding all these together results in 80 + 40 = 120 cards up until the start of the third month. During the third month, she accumulates double what she already held prior plus just last month's collections \u2014 thus doubling 120 (her cumulative card count through February). Therefore, if you multiply 120 X 2, your resultant figure comes out to represent 240 cards obtained during March alone.
