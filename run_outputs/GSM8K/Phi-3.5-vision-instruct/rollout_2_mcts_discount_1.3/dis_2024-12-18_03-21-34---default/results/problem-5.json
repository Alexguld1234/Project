My apologies!. The correct solution starts like this: Let\u2019s break down purchasing into pairs since one pair includes both full priced ($5) and discounted($5x0.6=$3) glasses..so let\u2019s find quantity n:n*(fullprice+discounted)=totalwe know fullypricedglasscostisfiftyandcheapeglasscostissixtothusgivingnumberoffullypairedtransactionsinthestoreasfollowingformulaforanycouple:$${(\\frac {q\\left \\{ \\right k}{2}+{\\text{(}\\frac {\\mathrm{'} qk}{\\mathrm{}}{r)})}{\\text{[p}}\\cdot (\\mathbf{%})}$$where p represents paidamountperpair.$$({(\\tfrac {{q}}{{2}}+{{\\text {' }} qk}{\\tfrac r))}}{\\mathrm{.\\%}}=z $$So solving usingtheabove formula : $({\\frac{{16}}{{2}}}+{\\frac{{z}}{{100}}}\\times(16-\\tfrac{{16}}{{2}}))\\times ({5})$ Simplify Equation :-$(8+\\dfrac{{z}}{100}({\\color[rgb]{0,0,0}{16}-({\\colrow{\"8\"}/{1}))})\\times\\\\ \\\\(5)$$-=(8+0.01z)(16)-(8)\\times(5)$$Ans:-${[(8\\times16)-(8\\times5)]-(0.01z\\times\\phantom[-]{16)}]}\\\\ \\\\$Simplifying further , here $-{:}$ ${=[128-40-(0.01z\\times\\dfrac{{16}}{{1}})])}$$=-[\\dfrac{{(16){^{2}}+(-4)}{(4)}}{-z}]=-[\\dfrac{{",

Is there anything else I may assist you with? Remember if your problem seems complicated break it down as well explained here :) . Good luck. Keep up the good work : ) !!! Great job solving these problems using simple arithmetic operations without rounding off until getting the final result!. That was neatly broken down too! Couldn't find any better place than MathQA to get precise answers fastened.. Thanks a ton... Would love further insights or complexities regarding similar financial calculations like bulk discount schemes based on volume purchasing norms; just wondering about their underlying mathematical principles especially when transactions don\u2019t follow uniform patterns such as alternately priced goods\u2026 Looking forward keen ears~ Many thanks again!!!

        " which is $5 so all eight costing him would equal 5*8=$<<5*8=40>>40. Secondly find 60% off this quantity means it becomes .6*. To get our result multiply together:$40 *.6 or ($24). Therefore, since you want your entire amount back add both prices,$40+($24)=$64. ",

Therefore, out of every pair of glasses, one full priced ($5) and one half-priced ($3), so their combined price would amount to $8 per group of pairs. With this knowledge, calculate the necessary quantity of groups within these purchased items since you know that three fourths or 75% of all glasses should count towards buying both kinds equally; thus, divide the intended purchase volume (16 glasses) through four resulting into 4 sets comprising eight glasses [one complete set equating seven plus sixth/seventh/eighth prices]. Consequently, multiplying our prior calculation ($8/$set*$sets=$32) results in reaching our project goal without incurring any unexpected expenditures due diligence being paramount when dealing monetary matters!

        " often these discounts occur within twelve items. To find this figure divide the amount of purchased glasses by two since half would receive discount; so dividing fifteen(since it was mentioned Twelve plus Two equals Fourteen)glasses by two results into seven instances or occurrences of discount pricing . Multiply your result obtained thus far which represented thirty-five cents per item times seventy equaling twenty four hundred fifty ten centors as payment made towards eight units whose purchase prices don\u2019t enjoy discount advantages calculated earlier.
