        " = $129. Similarly, each cheesecake is priced at $4 and if sold in quantity 'x', it would generate 4x rupees (as per problem statement). But since we don't know value of variable 'x', let's represent this as 4*C_slice Rupees ($) which denotes Total collected amount through sale of C_slice Cheesecake Slices/Portions respectively due to missing information about exact numbers or parts needed. To find out the TOTAL MONEY Raised i.e., Revenues Collected Tom collecting all together from both Brownie & Cheese sales using above calculated Brownie revenues plus actual obtained values via Cheesebakery Sales; namely represented herein symbolically like below way : `R(Total)=\\$ (Brownie_Revenue)+[(\\$ /Cheescake\\_Slice)*\\^ (\\",

Consequently arrived upon following conclusion :- Calculated individual values obtained during process .. Comprehensively consolidated these respective figures using basic arithmetic operations like addition & subtraction etc... Resultantly derived ultimate figure representing entire sum procured through collective efforts expended thereby concluding said investigation ! That would mean if you multiply fourteen cents times thirty six thousands equals seventy seven hundred twenty eight thousand dollar one! You get exactly what I calculated above ;) Hope it makes sense :) This means when priced individually ($0.14)*times combined amounts $(=36K);It yields Final Totals$(=$)(as demonstrated below).. Thus providing clear evidence confirmation supporting preliminary computations performed throughout preceding narrative construction sequence hereinforth referred under 'investigation phase'. Regardless whether considering single entity contribution versus aggregate accumulation perspective respectively maintain accuracy integrity whilst evaluating overall performance metrics involved amidst specified context boundaries i.e specific criteria being assessed such fiscal responsibility among varying stakeholder groups participating actively pursuing common objectives sharing mutual benefits expected arising forthwith resultant proceedings yield positively reinforcing tangible quantitative assessments hence facilitating decision making procedures effectuating successful results achievable only possible utilizing collaboratively developed innovation strategically deployed leveraging competencies acquired via shared experience realm fostered communal synergistic approaches ensuring long term sustainability benefiting majority population sector engagement preserving ethos embracing diverse perspectives optimizing interdependent relationships maximized opportunities enabling comprehensive enhancement progressions leading transformational impact shaping broader vista beyond immediate scope focus promoting general wellbeing global prosperity human rights advancements social justice equality inclusiveness fairness universality peace harmony understanding compassion empathy respect tolerance cooperation coherence collaboration solidarity fellowship brotherhood unity fraternity patriotism allegiance loyalty commitment dedication effort tenacity grit resilience determination resolve courage bravery honesty accountability transparency integrity"
