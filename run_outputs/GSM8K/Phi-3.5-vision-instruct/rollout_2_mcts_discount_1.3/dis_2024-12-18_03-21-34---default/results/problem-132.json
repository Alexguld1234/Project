Next calculate ticket usage due to luge riders; since each person goes twice down the slide per trip(worthing another 6), this results into each going through sliding tracks three times ((both go thrice because one time was already counted as part their initial count)). Hence we need our figures multiplied again by 3 resulting into tripled value compared to first instance. Tripling means taking those sums individually: thus making it 36*3 amount equaling up to altogether using exactly 108 units or 'tickets'. And voila!
