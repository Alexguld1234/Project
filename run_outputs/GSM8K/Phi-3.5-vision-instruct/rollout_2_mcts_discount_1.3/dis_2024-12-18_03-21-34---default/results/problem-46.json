Substitute numbers into it as follows: 80(initial amount)+X(purchase)-220(work)=Y , solve X= Y+220\u201380 or simply ,   X=(remainder)++originalamountminususage.

        " initially had 80 post-its but ended up using 220 (since those matched exactly with every cup). This means during this time frame, including when buying new ones, only these could equal it -- 80 initial minus ending points plus current working ones which equals what was purchased. Therefore: [",
        " with 23 after using them all plus buying extra ones when you add both amounts together (the original amount and what was obtained through purchasing), this would mean candace acquired additional 197 sticky Notes which indicates these came included within new purchase i.e., it contains full pack size hence indicating **answers**=*New Purchase Size*. Without further information about initial or subsequent quantities though I cannot provide numerical value but could indicate process as answered above under assumed conditions provided.<|end_of_document|> The answer is: New Pack Size."
