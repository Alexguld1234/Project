Since I calculated these values assuming all variables remain constant throughout the journey , my current assumption about average speed being equal or higher than  averagely possible maximum indicated value may lead me off track eventually as soon as vehicle starts consuming more energy due lesser velocity relative to initial assumed conditions during computation which requires adjustment accordingly using appropriate equations mentioned below under respective scenarios depending upon their nature ; but here we need only determination regarding distance achievable through usage present resources without consideration over its changes along way :D Therefore knowing what kind o f travel pattern you might expect ahead before heading next time helps determine whether such estimates still hold true despite minor deviations occurring later within course range thus providing better accuracy when planning extended distances beyond original ones previously estimated .. However note also caution necessary because certain external factors affect overall performance directly influencing rate achieved regardless previous calculations; most importantly include temperature change causing difference both intra & inter alike weather patterns across countries visited simultaneously whereas others involve altitude elevation resulting fluctuated pressure varying impact level associated w/these specific locations themselves individually rather uniformly generally speaking amongst differing terrains worldwide although variation remains quite limited comparedto other influential sources listed earlier..
