        " the fair, so find out the price per ticket (cost_per_ticket): $20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket. Since they decided not share half prices fairly but rather equally divide their whole budget spending while taking into account both types purchases including individual amounts paid ($spent), you need first convert everything expressed as fractions or mixed numbers like those expressing partial dollar values such as $x/y or y*($a+b)/c$ etc.) directly to integer quantities n using simple multiplications i..e., change denominators if necessary multiply both sides numerator and denominator by same nonzero value z until eventually either get rid entirely off decimal parts by making sure your fraction equals m units lower below nearest integral multiple k... this means removing one unit part away altogether without affect its remainder when divided amongst 'k'-many people.... We use only integers here because nobody cares unless what these sums become afterwards!

That would mean the cost of their snacks equals (Ticket Price) times 3 minus $4.50 or ($17.25$); this comes up to about $12.75.

To find this out, add together everything they spent during the time period described above before dividing among themselves ($20.25 on tickets plus another $2.25 on snacks equals $22.5). Next divide what was collected (from renting bikes/rides) amongst everyone present \u2013 namely three people because you asked only about those participating (\"How much did EACH contribute?\"), getting your requested dollar values as follows: Each friend paid [(($22.5)*(Number Rides)/(Total Number People))]. Simplifying yields each contributed ((22.5)(2))/(3) -> [$11] per person according to my calculations based off provided data.. ",

Next, let\u2019s calculate the total spendings including the two rides together with their ticket spending (two times because three people rode twice). We already found this equals 20.25+15.75= $36.
