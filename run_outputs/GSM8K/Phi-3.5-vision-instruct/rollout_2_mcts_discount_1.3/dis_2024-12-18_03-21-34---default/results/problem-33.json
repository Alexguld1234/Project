        " the equation as follows: x (silver) + x + 30 (gold) = 110 Total Coins To simplify it further, combine like terms to solve for \u2018x\u2019 representing silver coins first; thus you can write this combined term equals just once which simplifies our equation significantly resulting into:  2x + 30 = 110 Subtracting both sides by '30', we find out what one group (one set containing single type i.e., either Gold or Silver coin), represents using standard algebraic operations results in :   2x = 110 \u2013 30 -> Simplified down via PEMDAS rule yields        2x=80 Dividing equal amounts across groups ensures even distribution amongst them & finally finding individual amount per group respectively yielding          => Solving Algebraically Yielding Equation Results           => By Division Resultant Value        Finding Solution ==> X(Silver)=      ===       =========>     X_SILVER CALCULATION AND RESULT    Using same result value found during above solving equations process directly calculate respective quantity present among other kind according to provided relationship condition --> Calculate Quantity Present Amongst Other Kind Accordingly Relationship Condition Given As Per Prev Process Findings ----> QUANTITY OF OTHER KIND AS REQUIRED BY PROVIDED CONDITION ALGEBRAICALLY SOLVING EQUATION--> [Findout] What Is One Single Group Represents Or Individual Amount Comprising That Same Set/Cluster Of Similar Entities Referred Herein Regarding Theme---> INDIVIDUAL ITEM OR ENTRY MESSAGE SUMMARY FOR THIS TOPIC:-[Final ",
        " equation results into 2x+30=110. Subtracting 30 from both sides yields 2x=80; dividing through by 2 provides us with x = 40 as your solution representing silvers coins. To find out about our required quantity i.e., golden coins subtract 40(our calculated amount for silver coin) from 110total which eventually brings you X equal value equals 70 being Golden Coin Amount Our ",
        " subtract 30 from both sides, it becomes 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2 yields x = 40 which represents the amount of silver coins. Hence the count of gold coins equals x+30= 70 . The answer is: 70."
