Firstly, we need to find out what one part of the ratio represents in terms of both tea and sugar. We know that together there are 20 parts (7 parts of sugar and 13 parts of water). This equals 120 units (7*sugar + 13*water), so one part equals 120/20 = 6 units. Since sugar corresponds to 7 parts, Katy would use 7*6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is: 42.", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13.
