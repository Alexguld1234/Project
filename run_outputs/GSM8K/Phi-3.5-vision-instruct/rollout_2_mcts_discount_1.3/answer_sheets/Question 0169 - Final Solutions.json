For weekdays, which consist of 5 days, he walks 20 miles each day, amounting to 20 * 5 = <<20*5=100>>100 miles. Weekend days include Saturday and Sunday; thus, with 10 miles per day, the calculation becomes 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 miles. To find out how much ground Pancho covers within a full week, add together the two different weekday totals. Hence, 100 miles (during the weekdays) plus 20 miles (on the weekends), sums up to 100 + 20 = <<100+20=120>>120 miles.
