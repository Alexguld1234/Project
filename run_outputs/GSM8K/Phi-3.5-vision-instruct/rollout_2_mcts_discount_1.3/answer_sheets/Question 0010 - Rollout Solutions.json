First, we need to find out how many downloads happened in the second month. Since it was three times as many as the first month, which had 60 downloads, it would be 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. Next, since the third month saw a reduction of 30%, we calculate the reduction amount (30% of 180) and subtract it from the total. That's 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads less. Subtracting this from the second month's count, we get 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month. To find the total downloads over the three months, add up all the monthly figures: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month). Adding these together, 60 + 180 + 126 equals 366.
