Since his ship can travel at 10 mph, he covers 10 * 3 = 30 miles in the first part of the trip. On the return, the ship travels at 6 mph. To find out how long it takes him to come back, we use the same distance formula: D = RT. Here, D is still 30 miles (the distance he covered in the first leg), and R is now 6 mph. Thus, we solve for T: 30 = 6T, so T = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.

From 1 to 4 PM, the time interval is 3 hours (since we subtract 1 PM from 4 PM). We know one way Tom travels, so let's see if his distance traveled matches our understanding. Let's assume the distance is D. According to condition 1, D = 10mph * 3h = 30m. With this information, using condition 1 again, it takes him D / 10 = 30/10 = 3 hours to reach the destination.
