[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year.

Henry has 110 cookies, but he dropped 5, so we need to account for those first. We then subtract another 5 because each of these represented a cookie he intended to drop but didn\u2019t. This leaves us with 110 - 10 = 100 cookies.", "2": "Next, figure out what doubled number this represents. Since Henry made 2 times as many cookies as he did last year and ended up with 100, if you divide 100 by 2, you get 50. This means that originally, he planned on making 50 cookies.

Before he dropped any, he had 15 extra over what he intended (2x). Also, before he dropped any cookies, he had 5 more than he baked last year because these weren't part of his original plan. Therefore, we can write the equation 2x + 15 + 5 = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 20 = 110. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us 2x = 90. Dividing by 2 yields x = 45.
