First, we calculate the current total number of potted plants Mary has on all the windows (2 per ledge times 40 ledges). That's 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. When she gives away 1 potted plant from each of these ledges, she gives away 1 * 40 = 40 potted plants. Subtracting this amount from her original total, 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants remaining.
