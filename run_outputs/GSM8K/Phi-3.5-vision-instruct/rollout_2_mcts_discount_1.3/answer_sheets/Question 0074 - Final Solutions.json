When we round numbers to the nearest dollar, any amount less than .50 gets rounded down, while amounts greater or equal to .50 get rounded up. \nNow let's apply this concept to our problem statement. Here are the calculations:\n1. Rounded price of marigolds per pot = $3 (since $2.74 is less than $.50)\n2. Rounded price of petunias per pot = $2 (since $1.87 is less than $.50)\n3. Rounded price of begonias per pot = $2 (since $2.12 is also less than $.50)\nNext, calculate the revenue for each type of flower:\n1. Revenue from sold marigolds = 12 pots * $3/pot = $36\n2. Revenue from sold petunias = 9 pots * $2/pot = $18\n3. Revenue from sold begonias = 17 pots * $2/pot = $34\nFinally add these revenues together:\nTotal earnings = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.
