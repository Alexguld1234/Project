First, we need to find out how many DVDs Billy sold based on the hint provided. The first 3 customers bought 3 DVDs (since 3 * 1 = 3). The next 2 customers bought 4 DVDs because they bought 2 each (since 2 * 2 = 4). Lastly, since the remaining 3 customers didn't buy any, they contribute 0 to the total count. Adding these amounts together yields 3 (from the first three customers) + 4 (from the second two customers) which equals 7 DVDs.
