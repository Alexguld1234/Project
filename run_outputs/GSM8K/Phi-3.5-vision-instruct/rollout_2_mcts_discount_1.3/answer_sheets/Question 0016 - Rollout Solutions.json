The second train goes northward as well, so it doesn't cover any additional distance compared to the first train. Therefore, the distance covered by both trains over the two days is simply the sum of their individual distances traveled separately during those days. This means one train covers 80 miles (westward), and another 150 miles (northward). Adding these up gives us 80 + 150 = 230 miles in total.
