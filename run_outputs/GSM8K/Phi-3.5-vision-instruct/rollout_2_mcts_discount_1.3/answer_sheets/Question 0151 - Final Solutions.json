Shawna charges 25 cents per tire. On the first day, 5 people came for both tires (so it's double the usual), so each customer pays 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. That's $0.50 * 5 customers which equals $2.50. Next, 3 people came for their tricycle tires\u2014each tire for each type counts as $0.25, but remember it's always the same $0.25 per tire because our hint suggests no difference due to size/type.

This means another $0.25 * 1 = $0.25.
