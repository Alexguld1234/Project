Each year, Tom increases his tree count by 10 trees for every one old tree he cuts down. This results in a net increase of 8 trees each year."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Firstly, we calculate the net gain of trees annually which is 8 (10 trees planted minus 2 trees removed). Over 10 years this equates to 8 * 10 = 80 additional trees. Starting with 50 trees initially, adding the 80 over ten years gives us 50 + 80 = 130 trees. Finally, accounting for the loss of 30% of these trees over those same ten years, we get 130 * 0.3 = 39 trees lost. Subtracting this from our previous sum, 130 - 39, leaves us with 91 trees remaining. Thus, the final count of trees in Tom's forest after 10 years would be 91.", "value": 0.59375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Tom plants 10 trees a year.
