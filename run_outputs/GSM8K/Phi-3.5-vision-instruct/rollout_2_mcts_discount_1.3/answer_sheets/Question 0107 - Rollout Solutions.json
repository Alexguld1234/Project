Frankie watched 1-hour shows on Monday and Tuesday, which totals to 2 hours. 1 hour was also used up on Wednesday as part of one 30-minute show. Thursday he used another 1.5 hours (1 hour for the show plus 30 minutes), leaving us with 2 hours - 1.5 hours = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes out of the remaining 2 hours. Since he watched two 1-hour episodes on Friday, taking away these 2 hours results in no available time left.
