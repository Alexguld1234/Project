Firstly, we need to find out what the doll is worth. Since it costs as much as three action figures ($5 each) plus one red car ($4), we can calculate its value: (3 x $5) + $4 = $15 + $4 = $19. We know that one red car costs $4. With 5 red cars, their total cost is 5 x $4 = $20. Now let\u2019s add up everything: (5 red cars x $4) + (3 action figures x $5) + (doll x $19). That becomes (20 + 15 + 19) which sums up to $54. The answer is: $54.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
