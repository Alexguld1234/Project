The probability of rolling an even number first time is 3/6 or 0.5. Since there are no odd numbers (or if we assume he doesn\u2019t get any odd numbers), the probability remains constant for both rolls. Therefore, the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is also 0.5 or 50%. To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers consecutively, subtract 50% from 16.67%, which results in -13.33%.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. There are three numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. Each outcome like this happens 1/6th of the time. Therefore, Jerry can get one of these numbers once out of every six times.\n\nFor two consecutive even numbers, he could roll either 2, 4 or 6 twice in any order. The probability for each pair (2-4) or (2-6), etc., would be (1/3) * (1/3) because each roll is independent. So, we calculate [(1/3)*(1/3)]+[(1/3)*(1/3)]+...+[(1/3)*(1/3)]=3*(1/3)^2=3/9=1/3 chance.\n\nSo comparing probabilities, rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/6 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/3. Thus, he\u2019s 3 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than he is to roll two even numbers in a row.\n\nExpressing the result as a percentage difference: ((1/6)-(1/3))*100=(-1/2)*100=-50%. We know the absolute value cannot be negative so, |-50%| = 50%. However, since a higher probability means being less likely not more, our interpretation here changes.
