First we find what 50% extra looks like per item. For her student loans it would be $300 * 1.5 = $450 per month. For her credit card, it would be $200 * 1.5 = $300 per month. And finally for her mortgage it would be $500 * 1.5 = $750 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we add these amounts together (450+300+750) which equals $1500 per month.
