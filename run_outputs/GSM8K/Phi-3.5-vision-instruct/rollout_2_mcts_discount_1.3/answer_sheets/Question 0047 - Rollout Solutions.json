John bought 5 blue ties at $40 each. That means he spent 5 * $40 = $200 on blue ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties, he bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so their cost is $40 + ($40 * 0.5) = $40 + $20 = $60 each. 10 red ties would thus cost 10 * $60 = $600.
