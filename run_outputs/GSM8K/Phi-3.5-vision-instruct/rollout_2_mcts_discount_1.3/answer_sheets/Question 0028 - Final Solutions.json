He stopped after covering 20 miles initially. To find out how many miles he traveled between the first and second stops, we need to consider just one calculation since both distances (before and after the second stop) include the same segment up to the second stop point. So, we simply take 60 miles (total trip length) minus 20 miles (distance till the first stop), which equals 40 miles.
