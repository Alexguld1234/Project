Before he dropped any, he had 15 extra over what he intended (2x). Also, before he dropped any cookies, he had 5 more than he baked last year because these weren't part of his original plan. Therefore, we can write the equation 2x + 15 + 5 = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 20 = 110. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us 2x = 90. Dividing by 2 yields x = 45.

Firstly, we know that Henry intended to double the amount he baked last year (2x). However, due to overbaking, he ended up with 2x + 15 cookies. Then, after dropping 5, he was left with 110 cookies. Therefore, the equation can be written as follows: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110. Simplifying it gives us 2x + 10 = 110. Next, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation which results in 2x = 100.
