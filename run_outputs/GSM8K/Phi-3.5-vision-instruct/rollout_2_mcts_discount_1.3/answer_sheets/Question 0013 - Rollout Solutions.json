We know that she had 5 vacuum cleaners left; therefore, these five represent (1/3)C - 2, where C is the initial number of vacuum cleaners. Solving for C when adding both terms yields: 1/3C + 1/3C = 2 + 5, or 2/3C = 7. Multiplying both sides by 3 and dividing by 2 gives us C = (7 * 3) / 2 = 10.5. This would be unrealistic because you cannot sell half a vacuum cleaner. Thus, something went wrong with our calculation. Let's reassess our approach based on the information provided: Melanie started with C vacuum cleaners. After selling a third at the green house, she sold an additional 2 units at the red house. This leaves her with 2/3C - 2 vacuum cleaners. At the orange house, she then sells half of what is left, meaning 1/2(2/3C - 2). Finally, we subtract all these from the starting number of vacuum cleaners to get 5, which equals C - 1/3C - 2 - 1/2(2/3C - 2), simplifying to 5 = C - 1/3C - 2 - (1/6C - 1), further simplifies to 5 = 5/6C - 1, solving for C gives C = 6. Therefore, Melanie started with 6 vacuum cleaners.
