First, we take the number of sides on a dodecagon which is 12. Next, we divide it by the number of heads on a bicephalous creature, so 12 / 2 = 6. Lastly, since the question doesn't specify the number of dwarfs with Snow White, let's assume it means any nonzero integer value. Therefore, our calculation remains as 6.
