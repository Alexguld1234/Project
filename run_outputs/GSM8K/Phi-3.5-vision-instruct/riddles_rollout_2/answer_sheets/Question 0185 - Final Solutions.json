However, because the prompt specifies adding the \"legs\" on a starfish,\" we should clarify what is meant by \"legs.\" Typically, a starfish (also known as sea stars) does not have distinct \"legs\" like terrestrial animals, so if we interpret the term metaphorically referring to appendages or points, it remains ambiguous due to lack of information about the specific species mentioned.
