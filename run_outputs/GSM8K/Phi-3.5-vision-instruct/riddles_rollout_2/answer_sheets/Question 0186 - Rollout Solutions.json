Now we add these 2 vowels together with the number of letters in 'LENGTH' which is 5. The result equals 2 + 5 = 7. Each butterfly has 2 pairs of wings so we divide this number by 2: 7 / 2 = 3.5. Lastly, count the number of G's in 'GORGEOUS' which is 3. Subtracting 3 from our previous calculation gives us 7 - 3 = 4.
