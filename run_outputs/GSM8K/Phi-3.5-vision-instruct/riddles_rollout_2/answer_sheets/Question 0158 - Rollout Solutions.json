First, we start with the number of stripes on the US flag which is 13. Next, multiply this by the number of vowels in 'AMERICA', which has 4 vowels. This multiplication results in 13 * 4 = 52. Finally, we need to subtract the number of pairs of shoes in 6 pairs; since each pair consists of two shoes, that's 6 * 2 = 12. Subtracting this last value yields us 52 - 12 = 40.
