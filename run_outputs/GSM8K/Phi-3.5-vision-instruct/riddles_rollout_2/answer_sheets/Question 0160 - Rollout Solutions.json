The Olympic rings have 5 rings (one blue, one red, yellow, black, white). Adding them up gets us 48 + 5 = 53. A standard pair of eyeglasses typically comes with 2 lenses. Therefore, we multiply 53 * 2 to get 106. There are three vowels ('E', 'I', 'A') in 'TESTING'. Subtracting these leaves us 106 - 3 = 103.
