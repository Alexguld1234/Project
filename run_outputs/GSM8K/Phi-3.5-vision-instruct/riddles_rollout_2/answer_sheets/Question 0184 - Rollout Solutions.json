First we take the number of hours in a day, which is 24. Then we add the number of eyes on three cats, so 24 + 6 = 30. Next, we need to count the vowels in 'UNIVERSE'. There are 5 vowels ('U', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'E'). We then divide our current sum 30 by this number 5 which is 30 / 5 = 6. Finally, we multiply this result by the number of wheels on a standard skateboard, which is 4. So, 6 multiplied by 4 is 24.
