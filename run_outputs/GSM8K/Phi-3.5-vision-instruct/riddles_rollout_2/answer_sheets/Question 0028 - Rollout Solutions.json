Two hands together make 10 fingers each time because we count them one finger per second until reaching ten (a counting sequence like one, two, three...). This happens twice since we need the total for both hands; hence, 20 fingers in total. Subtracting the number of Great Lakes which is 5 from the total number of fingers which equals 20 gives us 20 - 5 = 15 as the result. The answer is: 15.", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Subtract the number of Great Lakes from the number of fingers on two hands.", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many fingers do two hands have in total?", "subanswer": {"text": "Each hand has five fingers, so two hands together have 5 * 2 = 10 fingers.
