A triangle has 3 sides. A typical bicycle has 2 wheels. If you subtract the number of wheels on a bicycle from the number of sides on a triangle, the result would be 3 - 2 = 1. However, since both sides on a shape and wheels are discrete quantities, subtracting one whole entity from another doesn't yield meaningful information about shapes without contextual clarification regarding what is being measured or counted.
