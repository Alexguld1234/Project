First, we know from both conditions that 'MISSISSIPPI' contains 11 letters in total (condition 1). From condition 2, we also know that there are 4 'S' letters within those 11 characters. To find out what happens when you subtract the number of 'S' letters from the total count, simply perform the subtraction: 11 - 4 = 7.
