First, we need to identify which letters make up the word 'INTERESTING': I, N, T, E, R, S, T, I, N, G. That makes it 10 letters. We also need to consider the vowel counts in 'QUESTION': Q, U, E, I, O, I, N, S, T. There are 3 vowels. Subtracting them from the total letters gives us 10 - 3 = 7. Since one human head represents 1 unit, adding the three human heads amounts to 3 units. Hence, we calculate the new value as follows: 7 (from the letters and subtracted vowels) + 9 (from the human heads) = 16.

First, let's count the consonants in 'INTERESTING', which are I, N, T, R, S, T, N, G - there are 7 consonants. Next, we need to subtract the number of vowels in 'QUESTION', which are Q, U, E, I, O, I. Since vowel appears twice ('QUI'), we have 5 vowels in total.

First, we need to calculate the difference between the number of letters in INTERESTING and the number of vowels in QUESTION. INTERESTING has 7 letters (T, I, R, E, S, T, I) and QUESTION has 5 vowels (Q, U, E, I). The difference is 7 - 5 = 2. Next, add three heads because humans typically have one head each, so 2 + 3 = 5. Lastly, assuming each human has two legs, thus four 'wheels', if we take 2 as the multiplier factor, it becomes 5 * 2 = 10. However, the hint asks us not to use the wheels, which means we don't include any additional value based on wheels. Therefore, our final calculation only includes the original numbers involved in the puzzle, resulting in 7 (letters), 5 (human heads), and excludes any other element suggested by the hint about wheels. Hence, the precise numerical answer according to instructions would remain just the sum of these elements without further multiplication or addition since there are no clear units specified for their values. Let's say this puzzle was intended to keep all components abstract rather than apply them to physical quantities like time, weight, etc. Thus, we can conclude that the answer is: 12.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
