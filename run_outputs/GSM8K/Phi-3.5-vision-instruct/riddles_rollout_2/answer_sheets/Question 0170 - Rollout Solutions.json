First, we need to identify the consonants in 'COMPUTATIONAL' which are C, M, P, T, T, O, N, L, I, S. That makes 9 consonants (as hinted). Next, count the vowels in 'ALGORITHM', which are A, E, I, O, U. This gives us 5 vowels. \n\nNow subtract the number of vowels from the number of consonants in 'COMPUTATIONAL':\n9 - 5 = 4.  \n\nMultiply this result by the number of wheels on a typical car, which is usually 4. Therefore, 4 * 4 = 16. \n\nThen, add the number of 'E's in 'BEEKEEPER'. There are three 'E's. \n\nSo, 16 + 3 = 19. The answer is: 19.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
