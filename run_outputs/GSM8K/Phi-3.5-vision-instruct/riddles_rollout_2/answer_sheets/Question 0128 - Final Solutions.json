Condition 1 tells us there are 10 fingers on two hands which means we count them as individual digits or fingers but actually represent two separate hands. Condition 2 tells us that humans typically have 2 elbows (one per hand). So if we divide the total number of 'digits' representing fingers (which are 2 sets of 5) by the average number of elbows, it would become 10 / 2 = 5. However, since this calculation doesn\u2019t account for multiple sets of fingers, let\u2019s reinterpret the problem statement considering only unique fingers across all hands. There can never be fewer than 10 distinct fingers because someone cannot have less than two hands; thus, our division approach may not make sense as stated. Instead, looking just at the unique finger counts, 5 unique fingers. But if we need to use the original set up provided in the prompt, we would stick to 10 divided by 2 which is also 5 assuming each pair is counted once despite being represented twice due to having two hands. Therefore, based on common interpretations, our operation yields an undetermined result as we are dividing by zero (the average number of elbows on one human body), leading us into a logical contradiction.
