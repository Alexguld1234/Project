Hours in a week are calculated by multiplying the number of hours in a day (24) by the number of days in a week (7). This results in 24 * 7 = 168 hours in a week. The number of legs on a horse is traditionally considered to be 4. To find out what we need to subtract, first divide the number of hours in a week by the number of legs on a horse: 168 / 4 = 42.
