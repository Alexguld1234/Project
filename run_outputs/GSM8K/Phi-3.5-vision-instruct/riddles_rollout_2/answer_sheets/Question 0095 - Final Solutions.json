To find out what dividing the number of legs by the number of heads looks like, we use this ratio: 8 legs / 1 head. Since any number divided by itself equals one, we get 8/1 which simplifies to 8. However, since you asked about dividing the number of legs on two dogs (which we already calculated as 8) by the number of heads on one dog (which is 1), the result remains the same.
