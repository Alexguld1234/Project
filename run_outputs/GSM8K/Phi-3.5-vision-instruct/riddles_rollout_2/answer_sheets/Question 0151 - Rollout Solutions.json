First, we find out there are 72 hours in 3 days (since each day has 24 hours). Next, we add the number of legs on a tripod; since a tripod typically has 3 legs, we add 3. Finally, we need to subtract the number of sides on a square, which is 4. So our calculation goes as follows: 72 + 3 - 4. Doing the math, 72 + 3 equals 75, then subtract 4 to get 71.
