That makes it 3 + 2 = 5 times vowels occur. Each occurrence of a vowel counts as one thing, so you multiply 5 vowels by 1, which equals 5. There are 5 rings on the Olympic flag. Multiplying these together, we get 5 * 5 = 25. There are 10 toes per foot, and since there are two feet, that adds up to 20 toes. Subtracting this from our previous result: 25 - 20 = 5.
