First, we count the letters in 'PHENOMENON', which totals 11. Next, we identify the vowels in 'ENCYCLOPEDIA', amounting to 6. Subtracting the vowels from the total number of letters leaves us with 5. The hint tells us there are 13 stripes on the US flag. Now we multiply this by the horns on a rhinoceros (which we assume as 2): 13 (stripes on US flag) x 2 (horns on rhinoceros) = 26.
