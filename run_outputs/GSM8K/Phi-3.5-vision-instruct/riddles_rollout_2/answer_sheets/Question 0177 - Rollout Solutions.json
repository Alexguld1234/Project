Next, subtracting the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', and 'U' which adds up to 4, leaves us with 11 - 4 = 7 non-vowel letters.\n\nSecondly, counting the occurrence of prime numbers within these non-vowel letters: 'E' appears twice, but since 2 is not considered as it's only counted once regardless of repetition, our count remains unaffected. Adding any other prime numbers would not change this outcome either, so primes don't contribute here. We continue with counting all unique letters except for the repeated ones, leaving us still with 7 non-vowel characters.\n\nFinally, multiplying this value by the count of bed legs, typically 4, yields 7 times 4. Hence, 7 * 4 = 28. The answer to the instruction is thus 28 when considering both parts required by the equation.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
