First we start with 90 degrees since it's a right angle. Next, add the number of letters in 'RIGHT', which is 4. Now we need to multiply this sum by the number of legs on an office chair, which is 5. So the calculation would look like: 90 (right angles) + 4 ('RIGHT') = 94; 94 * 5 (office chair legs) = 470.
