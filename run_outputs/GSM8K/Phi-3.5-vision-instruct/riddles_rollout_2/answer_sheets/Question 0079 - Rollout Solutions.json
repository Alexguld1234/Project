The word 'BREAD' consists of 5 characters or letters. To find out how many items remain if we remove these letters, we perform a simple subtraction operation. We subtract the number of letters in 'BREAD' from the number of items in a baker's dozen which yields: 13 - 5 = 8. The answer is: 8.", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
