We know that there are 31 days in March (so we use 31). In 'PHOTOGRAPH,' there is only one 'O.' Let's plug these into our equation: 31 (days) multiplied by 1 (letter O) equals 31. Finally, we are instructed to subtract the number of letters in the word 'FRIDAY,' which is 5. However, since all previous calculations resulted in just 31 without any subtraction needed, the hint seems to be leading us astray as it suggests performing unnecessary operations. Given the constraints provided, let's ignore the subtraction part because it would result in zero anyway, maintaining consistent value across equations: 31 (from 31 days) + 1 (for 'O') = 32. Since adding and removing 5 doesn't change the outcome, those parts of the instructions are irrelevant under the conditions stated.

Now, we need to subtract the letters in 'FRIDAY' from our result. We already established it's 5. Therefore, 31 - 5 = 26. Lastly, since we have to add the sides of a square, but squares don't actually have different 'sides'; every side is equal in length. If you consider all four sides as one set or as part of your next calculation, adding them would just give us back the original value before subtraction.
