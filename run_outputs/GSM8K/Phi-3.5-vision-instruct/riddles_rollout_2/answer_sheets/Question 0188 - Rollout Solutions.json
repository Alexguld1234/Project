Firstly, we calculate the sum of the number of sides on an enneagon which is 9, and the number of vowels in 'SYZYGY', which has 3 vowels ('Y' appearing twice). This totals 9 + 3 = 12. Next, consider a typical three-legged tripod; multiplying this result by the number of legs on a tripod gives us 12 * 3 = 36. Finally, we subtract the heads on a two-headed eagle, but since no numerical value or additional instruction was provided regarding the head count of such a creature, we cannot perform this subtraction as instructed.

We start with an enneagon which has 9 sides. Next, we look at the word 'SYZYGY'. It contains no letters other than Y, so it doesn't change our calculation since all 3 Y's are counted as vowels. We multiply this quantity, 9 * 3 = 27. Finally, a typical tripod has 3 legs, but we don't see any mention of an eagle or its heads; thus, we can disregard information about an eagle's head(s). Therefore, without considering the eagle head, the answer is simply the result of 27 because multiplying sides of an enneagon (which is 9) by the count of vowels (which is 3, due to the repetition of the letter Y) results in the value 27.
