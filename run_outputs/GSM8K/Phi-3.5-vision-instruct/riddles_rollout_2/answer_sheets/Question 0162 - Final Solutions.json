The average number of hands a person has can vary based on perspective (usually considered as 2).\n\n4. The sides of a regular square are equal; since squares don't change size (we consider them constant), we just need their count. Squares typically have 4 visible edges if viewed directly or 4 corners when viewed face up/down depending upon context but here let's use 4 for simplicity as no specific shape was mentioned.\n\nNow we calculate:\n\n1. Adding together the letters in 'PHILOSOPHY' plus the days in December gives us 10 + 31 = 41.\n\n2. Dividing by the number of hands one person might have, which is commonly 2, results in 41 / 2 = 20.5. Since you cannot divide something into half and still get a whole number, we take the integer part only, so we keep 20.\n\n3. Multiplying by the sides of a square yields 20 * 4 = 80.
