Next, multiply this number by the number of legs on a beetle; since beetles have 6 legs, 8 times 6 equals 48. Last, subtract the number of primary colors, which is three: 48 - 3 = 45. The answer is: 45.", "value": 0.71875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Count the letters in 'INTRICATE'.
