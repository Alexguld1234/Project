Next, we consider the hint about the classical planets being counted twice due to Mars appearing twice in our list (one time when counting the sun as part of the solar system and one time separately). This leads to having too few elements here since we only want to count unique planets once. However, ignoring this issue, we would proceed as follows: Subtracting the number of classical planets (10) from the letter count yields zero. Since we need to multiply by the number of toes on two human feet, let's calculate that. Two feet have fourteen toes. Therefore, multiplying zero by fourteen still results in zero. Finally, adding the sum of prime numbers less than five (which are 2, 3, and 5 because ten isn't included according to the instruction), adds another three to get 8. But remember, all multiplication steps before were zero, so the addition doesn\u2019t change the outcome. Thus, regardless of performing any further calculations, the result remains 0.

First, we count the letters in 'UNIVERSITY', which has 10 letters. Next, we find out the classical planets are Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and we include Pluto, making it 10 planets. So, we subtract 10 (planets) from the number of letters (10), resulting in 0.\n\nNow, let's multiply that by the sum of the toes on two human feet, which is 2 * 10 = 20. Since 0 multiplied by any number stays 0, our next calculation remains 0.\n\nLastly, we need to consider the prime numbers less than 5. However, since 5 itself is not considered a prime number but rather a composite one, only the primes below 5 exist\u20142 and 3. There are 2 such prime numbers. Therefore, adding these together would still leave us with 2. But again, the multiplication outcome being zero from before means we don't actually use this part of the problem.\n\nHence, without considering the second half of the instruction due to the multiplication leading to zero regardless, let's proceed with the first part of the question.\n\nSo far, the calculations based on available data result in: 0 (from initial subtraction) \u00d7 20 (toes) = 0.
