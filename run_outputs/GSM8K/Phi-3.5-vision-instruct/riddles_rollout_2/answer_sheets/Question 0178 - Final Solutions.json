Firstly, calculate the hours worked which are mentioned as \"hours in half a week\". Half a week would typically involve 3.5 days; however, since we cannot count fractions of a working hour, we consider just 3 complete hours of work. Secondly, count the occurrences of 'L' in 'HELLO', resulting in 2. Thirdly, find the number of times 'A' appears in 'BANANA', which is twice (there are two 'A's).
