First, we count the vowels in 'EDUCATION': E (1), U (1), A (1) equals 3 vowels. Second, we find out there are six letters in 'PYRAMID'. Third, multiplying these together, we have 3 (vowels) * 6 (letters) = 18. Finally, dividing this result by the number of wheels on a motorcycle, which is 2, yields 18 / 2 = 9.
