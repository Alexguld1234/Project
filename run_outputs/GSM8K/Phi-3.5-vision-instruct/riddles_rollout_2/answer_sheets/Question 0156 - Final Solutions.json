First, we take the number of minutes in an hour, which is 60. We know that primes less than 5 include just 2 and 3, so let's add them up: 2 + 3 = 5. Next, we subtract this sum from our original number of minutes: 60 - 5 = 55. Since it asks us to divide by the number of eyes on a needle, which typically only has one eye, we can ignore dividing because you cannot truly divide by zero. Therefore, the remainder stays as 55.
