The Summer Olympic Games take place every 4 years. That means all sports events in both summer games occur once every 4 years. Since this question doesn't specify particular sports, we can assume it refers to all Olympic sports combined. Therefore, all Summer Olympic Games events happen every 4 years.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {"1": "A century consists of 100 years. In one century, if you add up 24 instances of the Olympics (since each set of four years contains one Olympic Game), you get a total of 24 * 4 = 96 years. However, since no specific time frame was mentioned for your calculation or request for a single year, we cannot provide a single correct numerical value here. Thus, instead of providing a singular numeric answer, I would advise clarifying the context within which you wish to calculate this quantity so that further accurate computation may follow."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "It seems like you might be looking for a way to determine a specific numerical result based on adding a certain pattern together\u2014such as the frequency of Olympic Games and the duration of a century. To achieve an exact number requires clear instructions about what these terms mean in the context of your question. The hint provided suggests considering only the summer Olympic Games, which occur once every four years throughout a century, but without additional constraints such as starting point or ending year, it remains challenging to provide a definite answer due to the potential for various interpretations of 'one instance'.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Add the number of Olympic Games held every 4 years (just consider Summer Olympics as 1 event every 4 years) to the number of years in a century.", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the number of Olympic Games held every 4 years.
