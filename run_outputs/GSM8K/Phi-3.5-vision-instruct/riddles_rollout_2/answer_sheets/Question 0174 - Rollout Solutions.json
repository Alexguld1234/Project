Firstly, we find the number of days in March which is 31. Next, count the letter 'O's in the word PHOTOGRAPH which has 4 O's. So, 31 (days) \u00d7 4 ('O's) equals 124. Subtracting the letters in FRIDAY, which is 6, we get 124 - 6 = 118. Lastly, adding the sides of a square means no change as a square always has four equal sides; hence you just multiply one side length by 4. Therefore, this part doesn't affect our current sum. 118 remains unchanged. The answer is: 118.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
