Firstly, we find the sum of digits in '2025', which adds up to 9 (2+0+2+5=9). Secondly, count the letters in 'PHASE': it consists of 4 letters. Thirdly, identify the continents starting with 'A': Antarctica. Finally, note the stripes on the US flag: 13 stripes.\n\nSo let's calculate it: first add the sums together: 9 (from '2025') + 4 (from 'PHASE') = 13. Now multiply these sums by the number of 'A' starting continents: 13*1= 13. And subtract the stripes: 13 - 13 = 0.
