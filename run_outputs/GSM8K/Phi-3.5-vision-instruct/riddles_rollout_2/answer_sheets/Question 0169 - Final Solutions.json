Firstly, let\u2019s solve part of the equation using the information about the decagon we know.

In case we don't use 'grass,' our calculation reduces to just the number of sides on the decagon, which is 10. \n\nAssuming no further context was provided regarding the 'dwarfs with Snow White,' our result stays at 10.
