According to Condition 1, 'RED' has X letters, which we know is 3 because RED consists of three letters. Similarly, as per Condition 2, 'GREEN' also has Y letters, another 3 since GREEN includes three different letters. Lastly, Condition 3 states that 'BLUE' has Z letters, but here Z equals 3 as well\u2014a common mistake might be to incorrectly count the letter 'E', though it appears only once. To find our final value, we simply calculate X + Y - Z. Substituting the known values, we get 3 + 3 - 3, resulting in 3.
