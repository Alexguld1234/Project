We don\u2019t include spaces, and leading zeroes wouldn\u2019t typically occur within a name like this unless specified, but for consistency here too let us consider only non-leading zeros as valid data points regardless of input. Thus, considering 'OXYGEN' as if it were a number starting at least with a zero, its equivalent would still remain unchanged due to missing contextual information regarding formatting (like leading zeros)."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Firstly, we ignore any spaces as instructed, so we look only at the letters themselves which makes 'OXYGEN' equal to six characters. Secondly, for Mars, counting each letter individually as a different digit: M(1), A(2), R(3), S(4) equals four distinct digits. Adding these together yields 6 (from 'OXYGEN') + 4 (from Mars) = 10.
