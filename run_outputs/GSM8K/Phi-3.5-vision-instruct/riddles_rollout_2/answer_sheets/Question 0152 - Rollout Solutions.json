First count the vowels in 'MISUNDERSTANDING', which are I, U, E, U, E, D, A, N, D, A, N, D, A, N, D, A, N. That makes 15 vowels. The Olympic flag has one ring. Multiplying 15 vowels by 1 ring gets us 15 * 1 = 15. Subtracting 20 toes (two feet) from this result, we get 15 - 20 = -5. However, since you can't have negative toes or vowels, let's consider it as if the number was 20 instead. So, 15 * 2 = 30; subtracting 20, we get 30 - 20 = 10.

First we count the vowels in 'MISUNDERSTANDING': M (not a vowel), I (vowel) appears twice, U (vowel) also appears once, E (vowel) appears once, A (vowel) appears once, so there are 3 unique vowels plus 2 occurrences of 'I'. That makes it 3 + 2 = 5 times vowels occur. Each occurrence of a vowel counts as one thing, so you multiply 5 vowels by 1, which equals 5. There are 5 rings on the Olympic flag. Multiplying these together, we get 5 * 5 = 25. There are 10 toes per foot, and since there are two feet, that adds up to 20 toes. Subtracting this from our previous result: 25 - 20 = 5.
