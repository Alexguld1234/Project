Let's call the number of times one team lost L. Then, if they won 8 more games than they lost, their wins would be L+8. Since both teams played out their entire schedules (22 games), we can write equations based on this information. First team's equation: L + (L + 8) = 22. Second team's equation: L + (L + 4) = 20. Solving these together might help us find the value of L. For the first team, adding like terms gives you 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2L = 14, which means L = 7 when divided by 2. That tells us one team lost 7 games, so the other team won 7+8=15 games.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A football team played 22 games.
