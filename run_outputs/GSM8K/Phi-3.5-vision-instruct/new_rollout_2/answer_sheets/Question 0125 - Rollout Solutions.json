When Julia initially received the spoons, she ended up having 12 after setting them aside. Before using any spoons for sampling, she had all those spoons plus another 3 for testing the stew itself. That makes 12 + 3 = 15. However, since we know her husband brought the additional spoons specifically because they were running low, it implies that this initial count doesn't include them. Therefore, she would not have needed extra beyond what she already had. The original question seems to imply that she always had enough spoons regardless of whether she used them or not. Thus, without knowing exactly how many she started with, but knowing she never ran short during the meal preparation phase, the most logical conclusion based solely on the information provided is that she started with as least 12 spoons (the ones she had later) and potentially more if she had prepared for situations requiring less than 12 spoons.
