Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.", "2": "Calculate the combined weight of 30 comic books.

First, let's find out the total weight of 30 comic books which we know weigh 7.5 pounds since each one weighs 1/4 pound. Then, subtract this amount from the total weight that Uriah needs to remove (which is 15 pounds). That leaves us with 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds remaining to be removed. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to remove 7.5 pounds worth of toys, Uriah needs 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.
