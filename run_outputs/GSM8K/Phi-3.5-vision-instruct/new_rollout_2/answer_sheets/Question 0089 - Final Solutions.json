First we need to find out who actually shows up to the party. 1/4 of 16 friends didn\u2019t show up, so (1/4) * 16 = 4 friends didn\u2019t come. That means 16 - 4 = 12 friends came to Christina's party.\n\nNext we calculate the amount of gift bags needed for these guests. Each guest needs 0.75 gift bags since 1/4 of them don't show up. So for 12 friends, Christina needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.\n\nThen we consider what her friend did. Her friend used 15 gift bags for 20 people but only 15 were necessary, meaning her friend used 3 extra bags. However, this doesn't affect Christina's expenses directly as it was not mentioned whether those 3 additional bags cost anything or not.\n\nNow let's focus back on Christina's expenditure. Since each bag costs $2 and she needs 9 bags, 9 * $2 equals $18 spent by Christina.
