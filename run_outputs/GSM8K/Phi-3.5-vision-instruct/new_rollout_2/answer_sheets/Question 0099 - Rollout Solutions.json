[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery.

Mary has 2 potted plants per ledge, so currently there are 40 ledges * 2 plants/ledge = 80 potted plants on her windows."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Mary starts with 80 potted plants (from the hint). She gets another 18 from the plant nursery. That makes 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. Tomorrow, she will give away 1 plant per ledge, which means she will part ways with 40 * 1 = 40 potted plants. Therefore, before giving any away, she would have 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants. However, we also need to consider what happens if her neighbor gives away all their plants as well; this event is not certain yet because it depends on when her neighbor actually decides to give them away. Assuming no changes due to the neighbor's actions, Mary ends up with 58 potted plants.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mary is an avid gardener.
