So the semi-automatic cars would make up the difference. We can subtract the known automatic and manual cars from the total to find the semi-automatics: 20 (total) - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual). This leaves us with 4 semi-automatic cars out of 20. To calculate the percentage, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100. That calculation looks like this: (4/20) * 100 = 20%. Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

Firstly, we know there are 12 automatic cars, 4 manual cars, which makes it 12 + 4 = 16 cars that are either automatic or manual. We also know that there are 20 cars in total. To find out how many are semi-automatic, subtract the 16 known types (automatic and manual) from the total amount: 20 - 16 = 4. Therefore, four cars are semi-automatic. Since we want the percentage, divide the semi-automatic count by the total car count and multiply by 100%: (4 / 20) * 100 = 20%.
