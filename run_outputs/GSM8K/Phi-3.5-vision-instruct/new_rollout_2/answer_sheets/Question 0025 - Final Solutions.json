We know she spent $50 in total including the pizzas. Starting off, we find out how much was spent on milk, which is 5 packs at $3 per pack, resulting in 5 * $3 = $15. Next, the cost of the apples amounts to 4 * $1.50 = $6. Summing up these expenses gives us: $12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33. To find the amount spent on pizzas alone, subtract this sum from the total amount of money spent: $50 - $33 = $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, divide the remaining amount by the price per box: $17 / $8.50 equals roughly 2 boxes of pizza when rounded down to the nearest whole number.
