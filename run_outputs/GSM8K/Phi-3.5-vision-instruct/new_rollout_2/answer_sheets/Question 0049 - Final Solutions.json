First, we need to find out the total number of units in Richard's apartment building which is calculated as follows: 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, let's first figure out how many are occupied: 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units. Therefore, the number of unoccupied units in Richard's building would be: 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.\n\nNext, we move onto calculating the total number of units in the neighboring building: 10 floors * 10 units/floor = 100 units. Since only half of it is occupied, the number of occupied units would be: 1/2 * 100 units = 50 units. Thus, the number of unoccupied units in the neighboring building would be: 100 units - 50 units = 50 units.\n\nFinally, adding up both unoccupied units, we can determine the grand total of unoccupied units across both buildings: 30 units (from Richard's building) + 50 units (from the neighboring building) = 80 units.
