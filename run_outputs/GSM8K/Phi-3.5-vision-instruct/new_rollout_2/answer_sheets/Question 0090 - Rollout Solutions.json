If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?

An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. Since there are 20 adults, Ted needs 10 * 20 = 200 lbs of potato salad for the adults.\n\nNow let's calculate for the children. They eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. With 5 children, Ted needs another 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad.\n\nAdding both amounts together, Ted needs 200 (for adults) + 25 (for children) = 225 lbs of potato salad for everyone at the picnic. The answer is: 225.", "value": 0.71875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
