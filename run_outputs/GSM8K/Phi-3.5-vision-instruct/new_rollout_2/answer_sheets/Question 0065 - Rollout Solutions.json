Since he watches TV for 2 hours and then goes to sleep for half as long, he spends 2 / 2 = 1 hour on reading when he watches TV.

He spends 12 hours a week on TV and reading. Over four weeks, he would spend 12 hours/week x 4 weeks = 48 hours. His brother spends 3 hours on TV plus 1 hour reading, which equals 4 hours.
