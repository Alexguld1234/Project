Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream each night which amounts to 60 servings over 60 days since there are 60 days in the month.

She needs 60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons. Then, find out the cost by multiplying the number of cartons needed by the price per carton; thus, 4 cartons x $4.00 per carton = $16.00. At the same time, compare this cost against what Cynthia\u2019s friend spends, calculating that six cartons would cost her 6 x $3.50 = $21.00.
