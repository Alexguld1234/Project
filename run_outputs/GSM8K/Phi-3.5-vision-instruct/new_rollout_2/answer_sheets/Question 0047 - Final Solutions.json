The red ties are priced at 50% higher than the blue ties, making each red tie worth $60 (as calculated earlier). Hence, John's spending on red ties would be 10 (red ties) * $60 = $600.

Firstly, we need to determine how many blue ties John purchased. With the information provided, we can calculate it like this: since one set costs $40, and John spent $200 on those ties, he bought $200 / $40 = 5 sets of blue ties. Therefore, John bought 5 * 2 = 10 red ties (since he bought twice as many red ties).\n\nNext, let's consider the cost difference between the red and blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so if a blue tie costs $40, a red tie would cost $40 * 1.5 = $60. Thus, when John bought all these ties together, the overall cost came out to be the sum of the individual costs. Hence, the total cost equals to the sum of the cost of blue ties ($200) plus the cost of red ties which amounts to (number of red ties * cost per red tie) or (10 * $60) = $600.\n\nSo, adding up everything, the total cost of all ties comes out to be $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.\n\nAdditionally, we also note that John's friend bought 6 red ties but the problem doesn't specify their prices nor provide any additional data related to them.
