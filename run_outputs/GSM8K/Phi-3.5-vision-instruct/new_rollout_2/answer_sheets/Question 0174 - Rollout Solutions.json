[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. While peeling, he accidentally drops a potato in the sink and has to start over. He has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the time taken per potato when peeling and cutting them separately. Peeling takes 1.5 minutes or 90 seconds, while cutting takes 5 seconds.", "2": "Sum up these times to determine the full process time for one potato. The combined time is 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.", "3": "Convert this time back into minutes since we know Billy can handle all six cycles within a certain period. The time spent on one cycle in minutes is 95/60 = approximately 1.58 minutes.", "4": "To cover the entire set of 60 potatoes, multiply the single cycle time by 60.
