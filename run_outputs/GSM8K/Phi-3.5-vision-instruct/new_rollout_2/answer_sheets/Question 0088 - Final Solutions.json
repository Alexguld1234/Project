First, let's find out how many copies Harald sold (represent this as x). Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we need to subtract those copies from the total to determine what Harald's record sold. We set up our equation like this: Marilyn's record sales + Harald's record sales = Total copies sold. This translates to 10x + x = 88,000. Simplifying this equation results in 11x = 88,000. To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 11, resulting in x = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies. To calculate how many copies Marilyn sold, we simply multiply Harald's sales by 10, which equals 8,000 * 10 = 80,000 copies.

Accordingly, Marilyn sold 10x copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, which means our equation would look like this: x (Harald's sales) + 10x (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000. Simplifying it, we get 11x = 88,000. To find out how many copies Harald sold, divide both sides by 11: x = 88,000 / 11. This results in x = 8,000.

We know that Harald sold x copies, and Marilyn sold 10x copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. So we can write an equation: x (Harald's sales) + 10x (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000. Combining like terms, this simplifies to 11x = 88,000. To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to solve for x. Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 88,000 / 11. This calculation results in x = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies, and because Marilyn's records sold 10 times as many as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10 * 8,000 = 80,000 copies. As for our initial question about Harald's records, since Marilyn's record sold 5 times as many copies as Harald's, if Harald sold 8,000 copies, Marilyn would have sold 5 * 8,000 = 40,000 copies.

How many copies did Harald sell?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let H represent the number of copies Harald sold. So, if we let M represent the number of copies Marilyn sold, we can write it as: M = 10H. Since both records together sold 88,000 copies, we can set up another equation representing this information: H + M = 88,000. Substituting 10H for M gives us H + 10H = 88,000 or 11H = 88,000. Dividing by 11 gives us H = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies, which means Marilyn also sold 10 * 8,000 = 80,000 copies.\n\nNow regarding Harald's friend, who sold 5 times as many copies as Harald did, we simply multiply Harald's sales figure (8,000) by 5.
