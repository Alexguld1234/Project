Meanwhile, her colleague Steve works as a full-time coach at $25 per hour for 40 hours a week, also for 50 weeks.

In one month (assuming approximately 4 weeks), she would earn 20 * 35 * 4 = $2800. The answer is 2800.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First, let's calculate Jill's earnings as a teacher. Since she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week, her weekly earnings as a teacher are 20 * 35 = $700. Over 50 weeks, this amounts to 700 * 50 = $35,000 annually.\n\nNext, we need to consider her coaching job. She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly coaching income is 30 * 15 = $450. Over 50 weeks, this comes out to 450 * 50 = $22,500 annually.\n\nAdding both totals together, we get 35,000 + 22,500 = $57,500. Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.\n\nNow let's compare it with Steve's annual salary. Steve earns $25 per hour and works full time (40 hours) every week. That makes his weekly income 25 * 40 = $1,000. Over 50 weeks, Steve earns 1,000 * 50 = $50,000 annually.\n\nIn conclusion, Jill's annual salary is higher than Steve's. Specifically, Jill's annual salary is $57,500 while Steve's is $50,000.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
