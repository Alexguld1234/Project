Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax for 20 candles since one pound makes 10 candles.

So he earned 20 * $2.00 = $40 from the sales.\n\nHis net profit would be the earnings minus the expenses. So it would be $40 (earnings) - $20 (expenses). His net profit is $40 - $20 = $20.\n\nHis friend's method costs $15 per pound of beeswax, which is less than Charlie's cost, so Charlie's methods provide a higher profit.
