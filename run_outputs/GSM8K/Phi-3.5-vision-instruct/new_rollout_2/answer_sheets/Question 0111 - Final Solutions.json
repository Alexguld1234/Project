Firstly, we need to find out how far Julia traveled before stopping to save the bottle. It took her 64 seconds, but part of that was to stop for the bottle. We know it takes her 16 seconds to cover 20 feet, so let's find out how long it took to travel the distance to the bottle itself.\n\nShe travels faster than 16 seconds per 20 feet; thus, it would take less than 32 seconds (which is if she took 16 seconds to move twice as fast).\n\nAssuming constant speed throughout, during those first 16 seconds, Julia would have rowed about 20/16*16 = 20 feet. This leaves 48 seconds until she reaches the shore. Since 48 / 16 = 3, it means she covered another 3 times 20 feet or 60 feet. So all together she moved 20+60 = 80 feet.\n\nHer boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it moves.
