First, let's find out how expensive the jacket is: it's three times the price of the hat, so it would be 3 * $25 which equals $75. Next, we need to find the average cost of the hat and jacket: (Cost of Hat + Cost of Jacket) / 2, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100 / 2 = $50. Therefore, the cost of the pants is equal to this average, meaning the pants also cost $50. Adding all these up: Hat ($25) + Jacket ($75) + Pants ($50) equals $150 per uniform.

Since the pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, first find the sum of their prices, which is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) = $100. Then divide this amount by 2 to get the cost of the pants: $100 / 2 = $50. To calculate the total cost of one uniform, add up the cost of all parts: $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.
