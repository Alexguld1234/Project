{"id": 163, "problem": "In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. A kid dropped one car, but it was unharmed. How much are all toys worth, if an action figure costs $5?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Three action figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.\nThe red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nSo all toys are worth 20 + 15 + 15 = $<<20+15+15=50>>50.\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
