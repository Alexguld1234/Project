We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let H represent the number of copies Harald sold. So, if we let M represent the number of copies Marilyn sold, we can write it as: M = 10H. Since both records together sold 88,000 copies, we can set up another equation representing this information: H + M = 88,000. Substituting 10H for M gives us H + 10H = 88,000 or 11H = 88,000. Dividing by 11 gives us H = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies, which means Marilyn also sold 10 * 8,000 = 80,000 copies.\n\nNow regarding Harald's friend, who sold 5 times as many copies as Harald did, we simply multiply Harald's sales figure (8,000) by 5. Therefore, Harald's friend sold 5 * 8,000 = 40,000 copies.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
