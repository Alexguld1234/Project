First, we need to calculate how much Terry spends on yogurt daily compared to his brother:\n\nTerry's daily purchase involves buying 4 yogurts at once, while his brother buys just one 4-pack containing 4 yogurts. Terry buys his yogurts more frequently than his brother but receives twice the amount, which makes their costs equal. So, both Terry and his brother pay $6 for their daily 4-pack of yogurts.\n\nNow, if Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, he needs to replenish his supply roughly every other day since he starts fresh again after finishing what he bought yesterday. Considering his brother only consumes 3 yogurts a day, he would also need to refill less frequently. However, our hint guides us to assume that all data used here represents ideal or expected behavior rather than actual usage patterns.\n\nTo find out how much Terry spends on yogurt monthly, we multiply his daily expenditure by approximately 30 days: 30 * 30 = 900 dollars.\n\nFinally, to determine how much Terry spends annually, we consider a full year consisting of about 365 days: 30 * 365 = 10,950 dollars.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
