First, let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. According to the first statement, Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

But wait! We need to make sure our solution makes sense according to the second part of the problem. It says her sister has 50 coins, half of which are gold. This means Gretchen should have twice the amount of gold coins compared to her sister since she has all 50 coins in the form of gold or silver. Therefore, if we subtract the gold coins from her sister's total, it should match the difference made when calculating Gretchen\u2019s gold coins. Since her sister has 50 / 2 = 25 gold coins, the calculation would look like this:\n\nGretchen has 70 - 25 = 45\n\nHowever, this doesn't align with the initial calculations because Gretchen was supposed to have only 110 coins altogether. To resolve this discrepancy, we revisit our equations considering that her sister has exactly 50 coins in total.\n\nSince half of her sister's collection is gold, that means Gretchen has 25 * 2 = 50 gold coins, matching the total count mentioned for her sister. With these new insights, we return to our original equations to ensure they still hold true:\n\nS + G = 110 (since G = S + 30, substituting gives us 30S + 30 = 110; simplifying reveals 20S = 80, thus S = 40).\n\nWith S known, we confirm G = S + 30 results in G = 70, perfectly consistent with both the original statements about Gretchen's collection.
