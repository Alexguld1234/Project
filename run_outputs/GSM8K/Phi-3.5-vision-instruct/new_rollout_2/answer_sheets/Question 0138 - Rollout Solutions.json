First, we need to find out how long it took Mark to complete last night's test. There were 75 questions, and he answered them at a rate of 5 questions per hour. That means it took him 75 / 5 = 15 hours to finish this test. Next, let's calculate how long it would take him to finish today's test of 100 questions at the same rate. Since he still answers at a rate of 5 questions per hour, it will take him 100 / 5 = 20 hours to finish today's test.

This means he ran out of time during the first test and could not answer any additional questions from then on. Similarly, he had 6 hours to complete the second test but required 20 hours. Again, he did not have enough time to cover extra questions beyond what he already completed. Since neither test was finished within the available time frames, Mark couldn't answer any new questions after completing the initial set for each test. As such, he effectively left no questions incomplete because they weren\u2019t part of the final scores or assessments; however, logically speaking, he would not be able to complete those sections until later due to insufficient time.", "value": 0.125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions.
