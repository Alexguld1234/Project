From Tuesday to Thursday, she slept 2 hours less each night (6 hours), which totals to 6 hours/night x 3 nights = 18 hours. Since Friday through Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than during those busy nights (7 hours), which adds up to 7 hours x 3 nights = 21 hours.

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. On Tuesday, she slept for the same time as Monday, which was another 8 hours. From Wednesday to Friday, she slept 2 hours less each night, so if we assume she slept 8 hours like on Monday, then on these three days she slept (8 - 2) hours each night. That means 3 * 6 hours. At the end of the week, she slept one hour more than the last three days, so that would be 6 + 1 = 7 hours.
