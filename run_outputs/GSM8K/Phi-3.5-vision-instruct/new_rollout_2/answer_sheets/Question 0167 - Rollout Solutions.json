First we need to find out Brooke's current age. When they add up their ages in 2 years, it equals 28. So currently together, they have (S+2) + (B+2) = 28. Since S = 2B, substituting gives us (2B+2) + (B+2) = 28 which simplifies to 3B + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 3B = 24, dividing by 3 gives B = 8. Therefore S = 2B, so S = 2 * 8 = 16. The answer is: 16.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

We know that Seth will be 2B+1 and Brooke will be B+2. Adding these equations together, we get 2B+1 + B+2 = 28.", "4": "Simplifying the equation, we get 3B + 3 = 28. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us 3B = 25. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us B = 25 / 3 = 8.33. However, since people cannot be fractions of a year old for our purposes here, round down to the nearest whole number because if you add any fraction of a year to your age, it would only increase by at most half a day or less, not changing the integer value of your age.", "5": "Therefore, Brooke is approximately 8 years old. To confirm, let's calculate Seth's age based on Brooke's age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we multiply Brooke's age by 2. Hence, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old. However, remember earlier when we rounded down Brooke's age due to considering the current context rather than the actual values. Considering the exact values before rounding, Seth would actually be twice as old as Brooke, thus he would be 16 years old exactly. As such, the original calculations hold, and Seth is indeed 16 years old."}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
