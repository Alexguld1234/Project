[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400-meter relay. Spectators cheer so loudly during the handoffs that the runners momentarily lose their pace. One of the two teams is very well-rounded, and each of their members will run their 400-meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400-meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the time it takes for each member of the better-rounded team to complete their leg. Each of them runs in exactly 55 seconds.", "2": "Calculate the combined time for all four runners on the better-rounded team. Since each member runs at the same speed, we can simply multiply one runner's time by the number of runners. This means each team completes the race in 55 seconds * 4 runners = 220 seconds.", "3": "For the slower team, identify the times for each runner based on the pattern described: First runner runs in 60 seconds, second runner runs in 57 seconds (60 - 3), third runner runs in 54 seconds (57 - 3), and fourth runner runs in 51 seconds (54 - 3).", "4": "Calculate the combined time for all four runners on the less well-rounded team. Adding up these individual times results in 60 (first runner) + 57 (second runner) + 54 (third runner) + 51 (fourth runner) = 222 seconds.", "5": "Determine the difference in total completion time between the two teams. The slower team finishes in 222 seconds while the faster team finishes in 220 seconds.
