First, we need to calculate the increased payment amounts per item. Student loan: 300 * 1.5 = $450. Credit card: 200 * 1.5 = $300. Mortgage: 500 * 1.5 = $750. Now add those up: 450 + 300 + 750 = $1500. This is what Jessica pays every month. To find annual cost, multiply this amount by 12 months: 1500 * 12 = $18,000.
