That means he covered 3*60=180 miles.\n\nNext, he spent the first hour in standstill traffic so no distance was covered during this period.\n\nThen he spent another half-hour (0.5 hours) traveling at 30mph. This would cover 0.5*30=15 miles.\n\nAfter that, he continued driving the rest of the trip time which was 4 - 3 - 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph. This covers 0.5*80=40 miles.\n\nSo overall, John traveled 180 + 15 + 40 = 235 miles away from home in the four hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah drove continuously at 70 mph for 5 hours covering a distance of 5*70=350 miles. Since both drivers departed simultaneously and Sarah continues to move while John returns back home, we need to calculate their combined distances. We know that when John reaches Sarah\u2019s current location, Sarah will continue moving away from him; since she already traveled 350 miles in 5 hours and John only needs one additional hour to meet her (since it takes 0.5 hours for him to return), Sarah adds another 70 mph for 1 hour making 70*1=70 miles further. Therefore, Sarah traveled a total of 350+70=420 miles.\n\nNow comparing these two distances, it can clearly be seen that Sarah is farther from home than John.
