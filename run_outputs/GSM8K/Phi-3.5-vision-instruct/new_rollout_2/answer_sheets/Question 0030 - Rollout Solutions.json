[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Firstly, let D represent Darrell's current age and A represent Allen's. According to the problem, A/D = 11/7 or A = (11/7)D. Their combined ages equal 162, so we get D + A = 162. Substitute A from above into this equation: D + (11/7)D = 162. Multiplying everything by 7 to clear the fraction yields 7D + 11D = 1134, which simplifies to 18D = 1134. Divide both sides by 18 to find D = 63. Now substitute back into the relationship to solve for A: A = (11/7) * 63 = 99.\n\nNow, for the second part of the question, if Peter is twice as old as Darrell, then Peter\u2019s current age is 2 * 63 = 126 years old. In 10 years, Allen will be A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

First, let's set up our equation based on the hint. We know that 7x (Darrell's age) plus 11x (Allen's age) equals 162. This simplifies to 18x = 162. Dividing both sides by 18, we get x = 9. So, Darrell is 7x which equals 63 years old, and Allen is 11x which equals 99 years old. Now, ten years from now, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.
