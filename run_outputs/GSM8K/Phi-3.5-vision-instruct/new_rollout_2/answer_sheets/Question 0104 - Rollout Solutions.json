Firstly, we need to calculate how many pieces Poppy placed on the board which was one quarter of all the pieces; so, 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. This leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces. Next, her mom puts a third of these remaining pieces back into place, meaning 750 / 3 = 250 pieces. Subtracting this amount from what's left means Poppy now has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces on the table ready to put together. However, her dad knocks over the table, scattering 30 pieces.
