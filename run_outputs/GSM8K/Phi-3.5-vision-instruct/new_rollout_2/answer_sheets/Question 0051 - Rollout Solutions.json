Tom sails from 1 to 4 PM, which means he travels for 3 hours straight (from 1 to 4). At 10 mph, this would normally cover 10*3 = 30 miles. But since he's coming back at a slower pace of 6 mph, he covers less distance. It takes him 30/6 = 5 hours to go back. So the time it took Tom to get back was just the initial 3 hours plus these additional 5 hours, adding up to 3+5=8 hours in total. The other ship travels at 8 mph but we don't need to account for its time because the question asks about how long it took Tom to get back. Therefore, the answer is: 8 hours.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.
