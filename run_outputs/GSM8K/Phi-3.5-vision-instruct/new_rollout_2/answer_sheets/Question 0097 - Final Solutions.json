Firstly, we know Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, which means initially, she would have used twice that amount while cooking down the juice. That's 32 * 2 = 64 ounces of juice. Next, since every ounce of juice comes from one ounce of canned tomatoes, she used 64 tomatoes. Each 16-ounce can contained three tomatoes, but if each can provides enough tomato juice for two times the can size (which makes sense because each can is reduced to one-third of its original volume), that means each can contributes 16 / 3 = 5.33 tomatoes worth of juice. To get 64 tomatoes' worth, 64 / 5.33 = approximately 12 cans needed, assuming perfect efficiency. However, considering the ratios involved, let\u2019s also check using cans providing exactly 6 tomatoes. With these cans, you need 64 / 6 = about 10.67, which isn't possible due to partial cans; hence, the most accurate estimation here is the former calculation.

Since one 16-ounce can makes 3 tomatoes before being cooked down, we need to calculate how many cans she would start with to make this amount of sauce without loss of volume.\n\nTo get 32 ounces of sauce from 16-ounce cans (before reducing volume), you\u2019d divide 32 ounces by 16 ounces per can: 32 / 16 = 2 cans. But since she loses half the volume when turning them into sauce, we actually need twice as many fresh tomatoes because only half of them turn into the sauce. Therefore, 2 cans require 2 * 3 tomatoes/can = 6 tomatoes initially. The answer is: 6.\n\nSecondly, looking at her neighbor who also ended up with 32 ounces but used cans holding 4 tomatoes each, it means they used fewer cans than Freda.
