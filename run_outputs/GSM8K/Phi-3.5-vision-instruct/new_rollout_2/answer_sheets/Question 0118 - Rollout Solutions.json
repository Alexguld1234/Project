To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract this amount from the total number of vehicles present on the second day. Therefore, if there were 30 vehicles in total on the second day, it means that 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles were added on the second day. Since each new container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of additional vehicles by 5. That's 20 / 5 = 4 containers.
