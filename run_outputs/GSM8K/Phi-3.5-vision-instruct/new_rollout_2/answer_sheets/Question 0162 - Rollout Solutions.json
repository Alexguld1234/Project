According to Condition 1, if the force acting on an object is perpendicular (90 degrees) to the displacement direction, no work is done. This means that when an object moves along a path without changing its speed or direction, but without any net displacement, it is not doing any work against friction because there is no component of the force parallel to the motion which causes resistance.
