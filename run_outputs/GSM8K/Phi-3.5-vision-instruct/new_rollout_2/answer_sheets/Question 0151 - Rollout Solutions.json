For the bicycle riders, there are 2 tires per rider, so that would be 5 * 2 * $0.25 = $2.50. The tricycle riders also have 3 tires each, so that would be 3 * $0.25 = $0.75 per ride. Since 3 people came, that's 3 * $0.75 = $2.25. Adding these together, Shawnda made $2.50 (bicycle) + $2.25 (tricycle) = $4.75. The kid who wanted roller skates didn't pay because she couldn't afford it or because she wasn't a customer, so we don't count any money for her request.

Shawnda charges 25 cents for each tire. Bicycles have 2 tires, so 5 people would mean 10 tires. Tricycles have 3 tires, so 3 people would mean 9 tires. Since there's no mention of charging for inflating the unicycle's tires (which doesn't exist), and skipping the roller skates request, we focus just on the bicycles and tricycles. For bicycles, it's 10 tires times 25 cents which equals $2.50. For tricycles, it's 9 tires times 25 cents which equals $2.25. Adding those together, $2.50 plus $2.25 equals $4.75.
