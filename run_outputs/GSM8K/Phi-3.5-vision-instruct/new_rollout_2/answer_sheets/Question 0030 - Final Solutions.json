First, let's set up our equation based on the hint. We know that 7x (Darrell's age) plus 11x (Allen's age) equals 162. This simplifies to 18x = 162. Dividing both sides by 18, we get x = 9. So, Darrell is 7x which equals 63 years old, and Allen is 11x which equals 99 years old. Now, ten years from now, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

Firstly, let's define 'x' as a common multiple representing both parts of the age ratio. Thus, Darrell's age can be represented as 7x, and Allen's age can be represented as 11x. The sum of their ages equals 162, so we set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. By dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we determine x = 9. Therefore, Darrell\u2019s present age is 7*9=63 and Allen\u2019s present age is 11*9=99. Ten years from now, Allen will be 99+10=109 years old.

According to the problem, A/D = 11/7 or A = (11/7)D. Their combined ages equal 162, so we get D + A = 162. Substitute A from above into this equation: D + (11/7)D = 162. Multiplying everything by 7 to clear the fraction yields 7D + 11D = 1134, which simplifies to 18D = 1134. Divide both sides by 18 to find D = 63. Now substitute back into the relationship to solve for A: A = (11/7) * 63 = 99.\n\nNow, for the second part of the question, if Peter is twice as old as Darrell, then Peter\u2019s current age is 2 * 63 = 126 years old.
