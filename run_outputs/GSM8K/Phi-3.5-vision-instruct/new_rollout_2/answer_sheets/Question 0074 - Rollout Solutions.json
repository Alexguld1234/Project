[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. Meanwhile, his competitor rounds all prices down. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the rounded price for each type of flower. For marigolds, rounding $2.74 to the nearest dollar gives us $3. Petunias would round up to $2 since $1.87 is less than $2 but closer to it. Begonias round to $2 as well because $2.12 is also less than $2 but closer to it. Now, let's multiply these rounded prices by the number of pots sold. Marigolds: $3/pot \u00d7 12 pots = $36. Petunias: $2/pot \u00d7 9 pots = $18. Begonias: $2/pot \u00d7 17 pots = $34. Finally, add everything together: $36 + $18 + $34 equals $88. Therefore, Artie makes $88.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market.
