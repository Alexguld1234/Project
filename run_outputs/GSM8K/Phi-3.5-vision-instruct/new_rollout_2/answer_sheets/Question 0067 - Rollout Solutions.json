The question provides information about another chest later; however, it isn't necessary for solving this problem. We just need to calculate based on what we know. According to the hint provided, there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so 175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies. Additionally, there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, which means 140 rubies x 2 = 280 emeralds. Summing up all these values, we get 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595 gems.
