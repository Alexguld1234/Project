First, we calculate the time needed for the actual city's distance. At 3 miles covered per minute, for 42 miles, the calculation would be (42 / 3) * 10 = 140 minutes. However, if we consider the exaggerated report saying it covers 60 miles, which isn't possible since it only extends to one end of the city, it becomes irrelevant because both ends of the real scenario cannot be reached simultaneously due to the limited spread of fog coverage. Therefore, considering just the actual distance of the city, the answer remains as calculated above.
