With $20 per bag, the total cost for buying the bags is $20x. Including the extra transportation cost of $4, the total cost becomes $20x + 4. Selling each bag for $30 makes the revenue $30x. The profit equation is (30x - (20x + 4)) = 400. Solving the equation: 30x - 20x - 4 = 400; 10x = 404; x = 404 / 10 = 40.4, but since you cannot have a fraction of a bag sold, round down to the nearest whole number. The trader sold 40 bags.
