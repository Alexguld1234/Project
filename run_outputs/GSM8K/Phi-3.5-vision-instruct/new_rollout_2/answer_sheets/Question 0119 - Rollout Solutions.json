His original salary was $40000, and it increased by 40%. To find this increase, we multiply his original salary by 40/100 * $40000 = $16000. Adding this increase to his original salary gives us his current salary of $40000 + $16000 = $56000.", "2": "Calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's current salary is 30% greater than Lylah's, we can set up an equation to solve for Lylah's salary. Let L represent Lylah's salary. We know that 1.3L = $56000 because Adrien's salary is 30% or 0.3 times Lylah's salary greater. Solving this equation, we get L = $56000 / 1.3 = $43076.92 approximately."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Adrien's current salary is $56000. Lylah's salary four years later would still be $43076.92 since no additional information about her changes her salary.
