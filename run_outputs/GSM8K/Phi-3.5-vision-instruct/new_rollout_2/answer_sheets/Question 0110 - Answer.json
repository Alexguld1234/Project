{"id": 110, "problem": "Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. While they were eating, their dog ran away with one fruit roll-up. How many did they eat on average?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.\nMarcell ate 42 because 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42\nIn total they ate 90 because 48 + 42 = <<48+42=90>>90\nOn average they ate 45 because 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45\n#### 45", "gold_answer": "45"}
