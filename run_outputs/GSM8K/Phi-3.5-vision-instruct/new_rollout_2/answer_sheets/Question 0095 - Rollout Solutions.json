First, let's find out how many boys there are. Out of 200 students, (2/5) * 200 = 80 are boys. This leaves us with 200 - 80 = 120 girls. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, we can calculate this as (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls in the Girl Scouts. Therefore, there are 120 - 80 = 40 girls who are not part of the Girl Scouts.
