Three customers bought one DVD each, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs. Next, two customers bought two DVDs each, which amounts to 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs. The total number of DVDs Billy sold is 3 (from the first three customers) + 4 (from the next two customers), which equals 7.\n\nNow we add the number of DVDs Billy sold to those sold by his coworker. Since Billy's coworker sold 10 DVDs, Billy also sold 10 DVDs plus the ones he sold himself, which makes it 7 + 10 = 17.
