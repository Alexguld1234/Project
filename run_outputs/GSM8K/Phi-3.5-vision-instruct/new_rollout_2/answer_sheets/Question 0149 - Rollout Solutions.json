We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and that he has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So if we divide 12 by 3, we get 4, which means Dorothy has 4 friends. Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we multiply 4 by 4 to find out how many friends James has: 4 * 4 = 16 friends. The hint also tells us to use division and multiplication to solve the problem. The answer is: 16.", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.

Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation: 3 * D = C, where C represents the number of friends Charlie has, and D represents the number of friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has 12 friends, so plugging that into our equation gives us: 3 * D = 12. Solving for D, we divide both sides by 3 to get D = 4. This means Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.", "2": "Next, let's determine how many friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up another equation similar to before: 4 * J = D, where J represents the number of friends James has.
