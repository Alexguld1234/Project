Jessica needs to calculate the minimum payments first. The minimum payments for each type of debt are: Student Loans = $300/month, Credit Card = $200/month, Mortgage = $500/month. To find the minimum payments, we can simply multiply these amounts by 1.5 (which represents 150%). So:\n\nStudent Loans = $300 * 1.5 = $450/month\nCredit Card = $200 * 1.5 = $300/month\nMortgage = $500 * 1.5 = $750/month\n\nNext, add up the three types of minimum payments to get the total amount she pays when meeting minimums. Total Minimum Payments = Student Loans + Credit Card + Mortgage = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month. This means Jessica spends a total of $1500 every month towards her debts when only making minimal payments.
