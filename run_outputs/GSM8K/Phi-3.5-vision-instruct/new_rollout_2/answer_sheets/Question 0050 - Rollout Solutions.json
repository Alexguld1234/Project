Since he gets 252 eggs per day, he can sell 252 / 12 = 21 dozens.", "2": "Determine how much money Lloyd makes per day. He sells 21 dozens at $2 per dozen, so he makes 21 * 2 = $42 per day."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd can sell each day. He has 252 eggs, which means 252 / 12 = 21 dozens. Then calculate how much money he makes per day. At $2 per dozen, he earns 21 * 2 = $42 daily. To find out what he earns in a week, multiply this amount by 7 (days in a week). So, 42 * 7 equals $294 per week. The hint also shows how much the neighbor makes selling his eggs at $3 per dozen. However, we need not include it as it doesn't affect Lloyd's income. The answer is: 294.", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
