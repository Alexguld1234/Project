Over 10 years, without considering any tree deaths, he would gain 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Adding this to his starting amount of 50 trees, he should ideally have 50 + 80 = 130 trees. However, since 30% of the trees died during these 10 years, we need to subtract this percentage from the total number of trees. To find out how many trees died, multiply the initial total by 0.30: 130 * 0.30 = 39 trees died. Subtracting the dead trees from the total, 130 - 39 leaves us with 91 trees remaining.
