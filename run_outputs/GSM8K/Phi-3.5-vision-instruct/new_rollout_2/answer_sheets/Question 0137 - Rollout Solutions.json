First we calculate the cost of the sub sandwiches: 2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15. Then the cost of the chips: 2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00. We also need to add the cost of the cookies: 2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00. Adding these together, before taxes and tip, the subtotal is $15 + $3 + $2 = $20. Then we apply the 20% delivery fee: $20 * 0.20 = $4. This increases the subtotal to $20 + $4 = $24. Finally, we add the $5.00 tip, which brings the grand total to $24 + $5 = $29.
