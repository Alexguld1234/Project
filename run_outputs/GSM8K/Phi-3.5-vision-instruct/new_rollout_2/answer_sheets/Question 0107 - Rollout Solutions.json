Since he already accounted for 6 hours of TV watching from Monday to Thursday, that leaves us with 7 - 6 = 1 hour of TV watching on Friday.\n\nOn Friday, according to the instruction, Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes which accounts for exactly 2 hours. This means that the remaining 1 hour from Friday can only come from the 30-minute show since no other information about additional shows or breaks was mentioned. Therefore, Frankie must have watched another half hour episode during this last hour of Friday.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
