Firstly, we need to calculate if 200 pounds would be enough for all 40 restaurants since each restaurant gets 2 pounds. Multiplying the amount per restaurant (2) by the number of restaurants (40), we get 2 * 40 = 80 pounds required. Since it was only supposed to distribute 200 pounds initially, but now the requirement is 80 pounds, this means 200 - 80 = 120 pounds of carrots will remain unused because they were meant for 40 restaurants instead of 40 - 1 additional stops. Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots won't be used. The answer is: 120.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
