Firstly, we need to find out how many extra points Mike scored during the second half due to his increased scoring rate. He scored 4 points initially. With a 25% increase, this equates to an additional 1 point every 5 minutes (since the entire timeframe was divided into two equal halves). Since the game lasted for 40 minutes, which is 8 periods of 5 minutes each, Mike would earn an additional 1 point multiplied by 8, resulting in 8 points. His initial score was thus 4 + 8 = 12 points.\n\nMike's friend scored 3 points initially and doubled it later on. This means the friend ended up with 3 times 2, or 6 points total.\n\nAdding both totals together, Mike earned 12 points while his friend earned 6 points; hence, Mike's total points sum up to 12 + 6 = 18.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.
