First, find out Alex's weight by multiplying Grace's weight (125 pounds) by 4, which equals 500 pounds, and then subtract 2 to account for Alex being 2 pounds lighter. This makes Alex weigh 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, add their individual weights together: 125 + 498 = 623. Finally, calculate the friend's weight as half of Alex's weight, which is 498 / 2 = 249 pounds. Now, let's see if it makes sense with the hint.
