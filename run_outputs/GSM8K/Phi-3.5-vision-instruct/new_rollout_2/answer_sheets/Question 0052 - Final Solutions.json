First, let's find out the total weight of 30 comic books which we know weigh 7.5 pounds since each one weighs 1/4 pound. Then, subtract this amount from the total weight that Uriah needs to remove (which is 15 pounds). That leaves us with 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds remaining to be removed. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to remove 7.5 pounds worth of toys, Uriah needs 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.

Thus, Uriah\u2019s original combined weight was 7.5 + 5 = 12.5 pounds. Since he needs to remove 15 pounds in total, this means there would not be enough toys or comic books remaining if he removed everything initially. However, let\u2019s assume removing all 30 comic books helps to meet the reduction target without exceeding it.\n\nNow subtract the initial combined weight from the needed total weight: 15 - 12.5 = 2.5 pounds. Since each toy still represents half a pound, to balance out the removal, Uriah cannot remove any additional toys as they are already accounted for within his current arrangement.

Since his friend\u2019s bag already contains 20 comic books and 10 toys, let's calculate what those weights would add up to. The weight of the toys can be calculated as 10 toys * (1/2 pound per toy) = 5 pounds. Therefore, in total, Uriah's friend has 20 comic books + 10 toys = 30 items. This means Uriah still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve this balance, since each toy weighs half a pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy, which is 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.
