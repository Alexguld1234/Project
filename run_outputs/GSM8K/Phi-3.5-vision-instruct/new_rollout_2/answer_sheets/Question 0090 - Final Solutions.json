Since there are 20 adults, Ted needs 10 * 20 = 200 lbs of potato salad for the adults.\n\nNow let's calculate for the children. They eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat 10 / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. With 5 children, Ted needs another 5 * 5 = 25 lbs of potato salad.\n\nAdding both amounts together, Ted needs 200 (for adults) + 25 (for children) = 225 lbs of potato salad for everyone at the picnic.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad one child eats, which is half as much as an adult. That would be 10 lb / 2 = 5 lb per child. Next, we find out the total weight needed for the children: 5 children * 5 lb/child = 25 lb of potato salad.
