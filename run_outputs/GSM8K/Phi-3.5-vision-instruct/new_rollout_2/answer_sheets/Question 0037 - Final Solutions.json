He sells these for $15 each, which would bring him 13 x $15 = $195. He spends this amount on video games ($20 each) which totals 8 x $20 = $160. Subtracting this from the money he made, we get $195 - $160 = $35 remaining. Since he also has $5 left over, it means he spent $35 (from what was supposedly remaining before buying video games). However, since no information about spending any of those $35 or having anything other than $5 left is provided, we assume that all $195 from selling Lego sets went towards video games. Thus, John still has all 13 original Lego sets because the problem states only that he ended up with $5 left; nothing indicates he actually used any of the $35 that could\u2019ve been spent.
