Out of those 16, 40% (which equals 6) enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves us with 16 - 6 = 10 students who ended up dancing to hip-hop.\n\nTo find the percentage of all students that participated in hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop participants by the total student count across both classes and multiply by 100%. That would mean we take our 10 students interested in hip-hop divided by the sum of all students (20 initial plus 15 additional), which totals to 35 students.
