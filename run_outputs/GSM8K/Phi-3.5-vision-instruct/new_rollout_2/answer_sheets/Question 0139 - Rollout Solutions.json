Firstly, we need to determine how many pink gumballs would be if no mistake happened. According to the information, there are 22 more than four times the amount of blue gumballs. Therefore, without any error, there would be 4 * 12 (the known quantity) plus 22 additional ones. So it would be 4 * 12 + 22 which equals 48 + 22 = 70 pink gumballs. However, since some were accidentally spilled, we cannot confirm this exact figure; but based on the initial instruction, before the loss occurred, there were supposed to be 70 pink gumballs.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
