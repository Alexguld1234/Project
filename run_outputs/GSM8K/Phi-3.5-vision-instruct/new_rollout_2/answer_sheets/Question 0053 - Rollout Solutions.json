[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars. For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and doesn't repair any truck tires. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, he repairs 5 truck tires and 6 car tires. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday. The mechanic earns money per truck tire ($60) * 6 truck tires = $360 for trucks. Then adds money for car tires ($40) * 4 car tires = $160 for cars. Total for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Firstly, calculate the revenue for Thursday. 6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360. Plus 4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160. Total Thursday revenue: $360 + $160 = $520.\n\nNow let's look at Wednesday. 5 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $300. Plus 6 car tires * $40/car tire = $240. Total for Wednesday: $300 + $240 = $540.\n\nComparing both totals, Wednesday was the busier day. The difference in revenue is $540 (Wednesday) - $520 (Thursday) = $20 more on Wednesday than on Thursday.
