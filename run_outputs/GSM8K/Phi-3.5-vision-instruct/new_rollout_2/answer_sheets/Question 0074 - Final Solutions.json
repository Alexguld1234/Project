So Artie makes 3 dollars per pot.\n\nNext, we calculate how much money Artie makes from the marigolds. Since he sold 12 pots, and made $3 from each one, he made 3*12 = 36 dollars from the marigolds.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at the petunias. They are priced at $1.87, but we don\u2019t know yet what rounding rule Artie applied as his competitor did. Therefore, we can assume that like Artie, you round them up to the nearest dollar. This means he makes 2 dollars per pot.\n\nSo, for the 9 pots of petunias, he makes 2*9 = 18 dollars.\n\nLastly, consider the begonias, which are priced at $2.12. When rounded up to the nearest dollar, their price becomes $2. Therefore, he makes 2 dollars per pot.\n\nFor the 17 pots of begonias, he makes 2*17 = 34 dollars.\n\nFinally, add these amounts together to determine the total earnings: 36 (from marigolds) + 18 (from petunias) + 34 (from begonias) equals 88 dollars.

First we need to find out which direction Artie rounds up or down. For example, if you round $2.74 to the nearest dollar it becomes $3. This means Artie rounds up because $2.74$ is closer than $2$, but closer than $3$. As the hint mentioned, artie's competitor is rounding down while artie is rounding up. Thus, our calculations will be different. Now let\u2019s calculate. For marigolds, he sells them at $2.74 per pot, rounded up to $3. So, for 12 pots, he makes 3*12 = $36. Similarly, for petunias, he sells them at $1.87 per pot, rounded up to $2. For 9 pots, he makes 2*9 = $18. And finally, for begonias, he sells them at $2.12 per pot, rounded down to $2.
