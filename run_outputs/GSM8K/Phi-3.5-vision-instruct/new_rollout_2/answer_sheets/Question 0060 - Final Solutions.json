We also know 2 are sour, leaving us with 19 - 2 = 17 good oranges. \n\nSo within the first basket, there are still 17 good oranges. As for the second basket, it initially contained 30 oranges, out of which 5 were bad. This leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 oranges. From those, 10% of them being unripe implies 10/100 * 25 = 2.5, but since we cannot have half an orange, let\u2019s round up to ensure all oranges are accounted for correctly, resulting in 3 unripe oranges.\n\nThis would leave 25 - 3 = 22 ripe oranges.
