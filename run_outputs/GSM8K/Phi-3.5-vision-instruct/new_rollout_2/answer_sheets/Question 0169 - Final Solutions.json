First, we need to find out how much Pancho walks on weekdays. As there are typically 5 weekdays in a week and he walks 20 miles each day, so for all weekdays together it would be 20 miles/day * 5 days/week = 100 miles/week. Then we calculate the distance he covers on weekends; as there are generally 2 weekend days and since he walks 10 miles each day, so for the whole weekend it sums up to 10 miles/day * 2 days/week = 20 miles/week. Adding these amounts yields 100 miles/week (weekdays) + 20 miles/week (weekends) = 120 miles/week.
