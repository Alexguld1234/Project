Firstly, we need to calculate the profit per candle for both Charlie and his friend. Charlie buys one pound of beeswax for $10 and makes 10 candles, so each candle costs him $10/10 = $1 in materials. Selling them for $2 each means his profit per candle is $2 - $1 = $1. If he sells 20 candles, his total profit is 20 * $1 = $20. His friend spends $15 per pound on beeswax but still sells their candles for $2 each. Since they also use the same amount of beeswax as Charlie (one pound), their material cost per candle remains $1. Thus, their profit per candle would be $2 - $1 = $1. However, since their cost is higher ($15 vs. $10), they actually lose $1 per candle instead of making a profit. If they sold all 20 of their candles, their total loss would be 20 * (-$1) = -$20. Therefore, while Charlie's initial setup involves less risk due to lower material costs, he may not necessarily yield greater profits than his friend who can charge more per candle, assuming demand allows for such pricing.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
