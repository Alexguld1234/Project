The problem states she slept for 8 hours.", "2": "Calculate the reduced amount of sleep for Tuesday through Thursday. She slept 2 hours less each night due to her activities, so 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours per night for these three nights. This results in 6 hours x 3 nights = 18 hours."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we know Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. From Tuesday to Thursday, she slept 2 hours less each night (6 hours), which totals to 6 hours/night x 3 nights = 18 hours. Since Friday through Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than during those busy nights (7 hours), which adds up to 7 hours x 3 nights = 21 hours. To find out the total hours she slept in the entire week, add up all the hours: 8 hours (Monday) + 18 hours (Tuesday-Thursday) + 21 hours (Friday-Sunday). This sums up to 8 + 18 + 21 = 47 hours.
