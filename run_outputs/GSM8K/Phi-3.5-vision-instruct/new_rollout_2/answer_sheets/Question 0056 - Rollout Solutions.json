With $42, he could afford only 42 / 15 = approximately 2.8 times or twice with leftover money, but since he can't go partway, he would still just go twice like before."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "For Peter alone, we start with 42 dollars. One movie and popcorn sets him back 14 dollars. Dividing his budget evenly allows us to determine how many complete sets of movies and popcorn he can buy: 42 divided by 14 equals exactly 3. This means Peter can purchase three full sets of movies and popcorn within his budget without considering additional expenses. Now, comparing Peter's case with his friend's, who purchases a ticket and a snack each visit, we see that Peter could only afford four visits whereas his friend could manage to go two times within their shared funds due to higher individual costs associated with snacks. Since Peter is not getting snacks, though, he effectively can spend less money than his friend when going to the movies multiple times\u2014the precise calculation here confirms why he fits more trips into the same budget compared to including extra items like snacks.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Peter plans to go to the movies this week.
