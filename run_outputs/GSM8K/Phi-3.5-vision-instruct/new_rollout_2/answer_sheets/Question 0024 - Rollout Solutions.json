First, we need to find out what the full price would be if it was sold without any discount. Since a 25% discount brought down the cost to $19.50, this means the seller received 75% (since 100% - 25% = 75%) of its original price as cash, which equates to $19.50. To calculate the original price before the discount, we divide $19.50 by 75%, or 0.75 in decimal form: $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.

If Kyle's book was sold for $19.50 after getting a 25% discount, we can find out what it would cost without any discount (original price). Let's denote the original price as P. Therefore, \\(P - 0.25P = 19.50\\). Simplifying this equation gives us \\(0.75P = 19.50\\), which implies \\(P = \\frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26\\). Without the discount, the book would cost $26. Since Kyle's friend paid only $21 for a similar book, even though it had a bigger discount, Kyle still paid more because his original price before the discount was higher. Thus, Kyle's discounted price (\\$19.50) is not less than his friend's discounted price (\\$21); so, the answer is: No, Kyle\u2019s discounted price is not less than his friend\u2019s discounted price.", "value": 0.7}, "ost_step": {"1": "The original price of Kyle's book was $26."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's find out what the 25% discount means. If we subtract 25% from the original price, it leaves us with 75%. But because this is a discount, we need to consider this as a percentage of the original price (100%). That means if 75% represents $19.50, we can calculate the full amount like so: $19.50 / 75% = $26. The hint told you already that the original price was indeed $26.
