This means not every car could possibly pass through in just one go as per our current understanding. We need to revise Step 1 since it doesn't add up logically because if 35 cars were waiting at the time when the second batch of 20 cars drove through, then only 35 - 20 = 15 would be able to pass through, not the 15 cars calculated earlier. Thus, based upon logical assumptions, we can deduce that the number of cars that passed through initially must be equal to or less than the 15 cars calculated previously."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Initially, there were 30 cars. During the first 15 minutes, let\u2019s assume some cars passed through. If 20 cars passed through later but 5 exited, this implies that another 5 cars must have also driven through initially (since those who didn't exit eventually did). So, 15 + 5 + 20 equals the number of cars that eventually passed through the jam. Hence, 15 + 5 + 20 equals 40. But remember, we cannot exceed the original count; thus, no more than 15 cars passed through initially.

Since no information about other vehicles joining or leaving this section was provided within the first 15 minutes of the jam, we can assume all cars stayed put until it began. Therefore, all 30 cars remained stationary during these initial 15 minutes. \n\nThe first part asks us to calculate the total number of cars that drove through the initial part of the traffic jam (first 15 minutes), but since none of them moved except for the ones who exited later due toCondition 3, their positions didn't change. So, the total remains the same i.e., 30 cars.\n\nFor the second part, which asks how many cars initially drove through the traffic jam without being added or removed early on, again considering only the first 15 minutes, even if some cars passed through, others didn't move unless explicitly mentioned.
