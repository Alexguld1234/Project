{"id": 172, "problem": "There are four birds at the Caboose. Sally Thirtytwo keeps looking for shiny objects, and the other birds keep squawking at her. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, what's the total age of the four birds?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally Four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.\nGranny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, meaning Granny Red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.\nSally Thirtytwo, Sally Four, and Granny Red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.\nSally Two is three years older than Granny Red, meaning Sally Two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.\nThe four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.\n#### 51", "gold_answer": "51"}
