Since Stephen's final payment included a 25% service charge and $3 delivery fee, it implies he paid more than his friend who paid only one service charge of 20%. We know Stephen paid $40 in total so if we remove his delivery fee of $3, he actually paid $40 - $3 = $37 for his groceries and the service charge. To confirm this, let's add back the service charge: 37 + 37 * 25/100 = $40, meaning our calculation matches up correctly. To determine exactly what portion of the additional $27 Stephen spent compared to his friend, divide their difference in spending by the total of both friends\u2019 payments minus twice Stephen's payment due to different service rates; ($60 + $12) - 2 * $37 = $156.
