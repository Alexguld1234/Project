He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph. Meanwhile, his friend Sarah is driving at 70 mph for 5 hours on the same day.

John spent 3 hours driving away at 60 mph which means he traveled 3 hours * 60 miles/hour = 180 miles. That was part of his initial trip to reach the destination. The answer is: 180 miles.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {"1": "For the second part of his journey back home, he was in standstill traffic for 2 hours and then drove another 0.5 hour at 30 mph. This is 0.5 hour * 30 mph = 15 miles. So, all alone, without considering traffic or other factors, he would need to cover a distance of 180 miles + 15 miles = 195 miles just to reach home. However, since we know it took him 4 hours including traffic, the extra 2 hours might mean additional travel beyond what's necessary due to traffic. We can say this extra distance equals 2 hours * 30 mph = 60 miles. Thus, considering the full 4 hours drive against traffic and non-traffic conditions, Jason effectively needs to drive only 195 miles - 60 miles = 135 miles to reach home.", "2": "We also add up Sarah's driving too. She drove 70 mph for 5 hours, so she covered a distance of 70 mph * 5 hours = 350 miles during these 5 hours. Since John's return trip includes both his travel towards and away from home, the difference in their distances is 350 miles - 135 miles = 215 miles.", "3": "Thus, John is 215 miles behind Sarah in terms of overall distance driven when he reaches his destination at home."}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
