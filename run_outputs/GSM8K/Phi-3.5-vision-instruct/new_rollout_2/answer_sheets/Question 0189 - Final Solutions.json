First, let's find out what three tickets to the fair would normally cost without any extra expenses. We know that each ticket costs $6.75 (from the hint), so three normal tickets would cost 3 * $6.75 = $20.25. Next, we need to calculate how much money they actually spent together including the rides but excluding the lost wallet incident. This means they spent $20.25 (tickets) + $2.25 (food) + $66 (rides) = $88.50. Lastly, if this amount is divided equally among the three friends, each friend pays $88.50 / 3 = approximately $29.50.

That's $20.25 as stated. Next, find the average cost per ticket by dividing the total cost of tickets ($20.25) by the quantity (3), resulting in $6.75 per ticket. With that information, let\u2019s figure out what they spent on snacks together. If they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, then they spent $2.25 on food. Now we need to add up all expenses: Tickets ($6.75 x 3), food ($2.25), rides ($33 x 2). The total cost is $(6.75 x 3) + 2.25 + (33 x 2). That equals $20.25 + 2.25 + $66, summing up to $88.50.

The average ticket price can be calculated as follows: 20.25 / 3 = $6.75 per ticket. Total cost on tickets would therefore be 3 x $6.75 = $20.25 (which matches). Since this is already accounted for, we move onto calculating other expenses. The text mentions spending \"$4.50 less\" on food compared to the tickets; hence, food cost $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25. Adding up both ticket and food costs gives us 20.25 + 2.25 = $22.50. Rides cost $33 per ride for 2 rides, so that's 2 x $33 = $66. Adding all these amounts together results in 20.25 + 2.25 + 66 = $88.50.
