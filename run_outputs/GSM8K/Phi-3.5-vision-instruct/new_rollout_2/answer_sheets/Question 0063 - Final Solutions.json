This means that for the next six months, she gets a 10% discount. The discount is calculated like this: 140 * 0.1 = 14. Thus, she pays 140 - 14 = 126 dollars for those six months. The total cost over the year can be calculated as follows: (6*140) + (6*126) = 840 + 756 = 1596. The hint says that if she were charged the same rate as her friend ($120), her annual bill would be 120 * 12 = 1440. By following Hint 1 we know that her current price is cheaper than what it would be if she were charged $120 every month.
