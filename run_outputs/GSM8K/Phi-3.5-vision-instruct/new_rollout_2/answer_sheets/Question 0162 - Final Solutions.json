Initially, a bag of marbles costs $20. Every two months, its price goes up by 20%. So, this means it increases once every 2 months over 3 years (which is 36 months). Therefore, it will increase six times over 36 months. Each time it increases by 20% which is 20/100 * 20 = 4. The total cost increment over three years is 6 * 4 = 24.
