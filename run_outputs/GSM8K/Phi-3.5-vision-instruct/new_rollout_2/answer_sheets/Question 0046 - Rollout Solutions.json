First, we need to find out how many post-it notes Candice used during her shift. She placed one on each cup of coffee, so she used 220 post-it notes for that purpose. She also gave away 50 post-it notes to her coworker. So, in total, she used 220 + 50 = 270 post-it notes. Since she initially had 80 post-it notes, and now she has 23 left, it means she must have purchased another 80 post-it notes (because 80 - 23 = 57). But this is not enough since she already used up all her original stock plus some extra, which totals 270. Therefore, we can determine that the question might contain an error or additional information needed because based on what was provided, it seems she wouldn't have any left over if 270 are used and only 7 are mentioned as being purchased later. Without further context or correcting assumptions about the usage of post-it notes throughout her entire shift, we cannot confidently provide the exact number in the package she purchased.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
