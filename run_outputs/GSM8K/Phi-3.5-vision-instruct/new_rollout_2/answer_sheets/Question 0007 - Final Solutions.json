Firstly, let's find out when the windows update interrupt happened during the initial download. Carla was halfway (40%) through a 200GB download, so at 200GB / 2 = 100GB mark, the update occurred. It took 20 minutes for the update to complete, so Carla was interrupted just as the download reached the midpoint. However, since the files are identical or compatible, we assume she won't need another restart unless otherwise stated. Thus, it would normally take 200GB / 2GB/minute = 100 minutes to finish without interruptions. Since the system forced a restart at the halfway point, the download process resumes immediately post-update. Therefore, the time taken remains unchanged despite the reboot, totalling 100 minutes. On the other hand, Alex\u2019s file size is larger; 300GB at a speed of 1.5GB per minute means Alex needs 300GB / 1.5GB/minute = 200 minutes to download.
