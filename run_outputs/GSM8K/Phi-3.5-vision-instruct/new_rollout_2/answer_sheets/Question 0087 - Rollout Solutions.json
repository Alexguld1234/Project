Her starting annual salary was calculated as $600 (monthly) multiplied by 12 (months), which equals $7200 annually. Next, we apply the annual raises over the next few years. For the first five years, her salary increases by 10%. This results in a salary of $7200 plus 10% of $7200, equaling $7920. For the following three years, this increased amount further grows by 10%, resulting in a final calculation of $7920 plus 10% of $7920, equaling $8712. Therefore, Sylvie\u2019s annual salary after completing three additional years of service will be $8712.\nThe answer is: 8712", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
