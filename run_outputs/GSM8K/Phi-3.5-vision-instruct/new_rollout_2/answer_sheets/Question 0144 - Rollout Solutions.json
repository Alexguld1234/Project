While discussing his business plan, a friend suggests charging extra for tougher cleaning jobs. Each client\u2019s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92.
