Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which makes it 5 days \u00d7 20 miles/day = 100 miles. On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day so that adds another 2 days \u00d7 10 miles/day = 20 miles.

There are 7 days in a week. Pancho walks 20 miles on 5 of those days (weekdays). That means he walks 20 miles * 5 days = 100 miles during the weekdays.
