We then get another equation because one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much ($66), so their combined cost is $99. Since the boots are $5 more expensive than the combined heels, we can write our first equation like this: B = 99 + 5."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's find out the combined price of the high heels which is $99 (since one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much). The boots cost $5 more than the heels, so adding $5 to the price of the heels gives us the price of the boots: 99 + 5 = 104.
