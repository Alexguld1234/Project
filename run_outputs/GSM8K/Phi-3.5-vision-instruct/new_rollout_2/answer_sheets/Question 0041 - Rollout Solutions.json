Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could slay the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames. But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Meanwhile, her brother could throw the same javelin only half as far. How far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?", "ost_step": {"1": "First, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the javelin if she holds the sapphire gemstone. She throws it three times farther than without the gemstone, so she can throw it 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet with the gemstone."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin up to 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it 1200 feet (400 * 3). Her brother can only throw it 200 feet (400 / 2), but since her brother\u2019s range doesn't affect the dragon\u2019s flame range, it won't change our initial calculation.\n\nSo, Polly can throw the javelin to 1200 feet away while holding the sapphire gemstone. However, this question asks about the outer limit of what she can achieve compared to the dragon's reach. Since the dragon's reach extends to 1000 feet, Polly must stay inside or within 1000 feet to successfully hit the dragon.\n\nTherefore, despite her ability to throw further distances, she needs to ensure she is no more than 1000 feet away from the dragon due to its fiery range. Thus, the maximum distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand to hit the dragon is actually just less than the dragon's reach itself\u2014which is less than 1000 feet. Considering her longest possible throw with the gemstone is 1200 feet, it means that any additional distance would exceed the dragon's reach zone. Therefore, polly stands anywhere under 1000 feet.\n\nThe final answer is: 1000 feet.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
