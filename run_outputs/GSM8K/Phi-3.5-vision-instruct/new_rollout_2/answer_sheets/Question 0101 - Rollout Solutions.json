First, we find out the total number of pages Solo has to read. We add up 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography), which equals 49 pages.\nNow, since Solo already read 15 pages on Monday, there are still 49 - 15 = 34 pages left to read over the next four days. To figure out how many pages he should read per day, divide the remaining pages by the number of days. So, 34 / 4 = 8.5.\nHowever, since you can't read half a page as part of your daily reading, if needed, round it up or down according to context. The answer is: 8.5.\nFor solving the additional math problem, it doesn't affect the number of pages Solo needs to read, so no change here.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook.
