First, we need to find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. The second friend pressed it 20 + (1/4 * 20) times. That would be 20 + 5 = 25 times. Next, let's determine the ring count for the third friend. Since this is 10 times the count of the fourth friend, which was 60, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 * 10 = 600 times. Adding all these up, we get 20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 600 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend). So, the total is 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 605 times. As mentioned earlier, Jerome's brother honked his horn 15 times as well. Therefore, including those honks, the doorbell made a total of 605 + 15 = 620 times. The answer is: 620.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
