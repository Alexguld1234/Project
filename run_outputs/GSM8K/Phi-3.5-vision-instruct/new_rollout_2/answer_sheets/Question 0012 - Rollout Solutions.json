Firstly, we need to find out when Carlos's lemon tree begins making money. His initial investment was $90, and each year costs $3, so the break-even point is reached when the profits equal these expenses. Let n represent the number of years required to break even. We know that (n * 7 oranges * $1.5) - ($3/year) * n = $90. Simplifying, we get 10.5n - 3n = $90. Combining like terms, we have 7.5n = $90. Dividing both sides by 7.5, we get n = 12.

He needs to earn back the initial investment of $90. Let x be the number of years needed to break even. So, 7*1.5x - 3x = $90 simplifies to 10.5x = $90.

Assuming Carlos would like all these losses covered by other profits, he would need to double the number of oranges sold annually, meaning he should aim to double his crop size. Therefore, he needs to plant enough oranges to yield 8 times more fruit (the equivalent of one lemon tree) to cover both himself and the $90 cost within 9 years. The calculation would be 8 * 80% (because he loses $2 per orange), which equals 64 oranges needed per year. Since an orange tree yields its first fruit in about 2 years, over 9 years, Carlos would need to plant 9 trees (considering they start bearing fruit within those 9 years). However, since he likely won\u2019t get any return until the tree has produced for multiple years beyond the break-even point, planning for longer terms might be necessary.", "value": 0.125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
