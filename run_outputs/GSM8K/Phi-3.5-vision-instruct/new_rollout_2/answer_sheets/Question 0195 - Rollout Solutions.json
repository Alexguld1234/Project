First, we need to find out the cost of a pen which is the sum of the cost of a pencil and an eraser. That would be $1.20 (pencil) + $0.30 (eraser) = $1.50. Since the cost of the pen is equal to this amount, we can say that each pen costs $1.50. Now, if Violetta buys 8 such pens, the total cost would be 8 pens x $1.50 per pen = $12.00.
