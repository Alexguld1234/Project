First, we calculate the number of people involved in the basketball teams and coaches. Each basketball team consists of 5 players plus 1 coach, making it 6 people per team. Since there are two teams (girls' and boys') per school, that means 2 * 6 = 12 people per school related to basketball. With 4 schools, this amounts to 4 * 12 = 48 people in total for the basketball.\n\nNow let's add up the soccer participants. Each soccer school sends out 10 players and 1 coach, so that's 11 people per school. With 3 schools participating, that adds up to 3 * 11 = 33 people in total for soccer.\n\nTo find out the total number of participants across both sports, simply add the two totals together: 48 (basketball) + 33 (soccer) equals 81 people altogether who participated in these sports events. The answer is: 81.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "There are four schools competing at a basketball tournament.
