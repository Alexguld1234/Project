In Dr. Wertz's school, there are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = 120 boys. That makes 120 (boys) + 60 (girls) = 180 students in Dr. Wertz's school. Since 5 students to every teacher, we divide the number of students by 5 to get the number of teachers in Dr. Wertz's school which is 180 / 5 = 36. At the neighboring school, since there are 120 students and 10 students per teacher, dividing 120 by 10 gives us 12 teachers. Comparing these numbers, Dr. Wertz's school has 36 teachers while the neighboring school has 12 teachers.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
