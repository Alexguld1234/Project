John drinks 3 glasses of water a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). That's 3 * 5 = 15 glasses per workweek. During the weekend, since he doesn't make any change in his routine except for having a soda with dinner, it stays 15 glasses. Including Sunday, there are 8 days in a week, so he would normally have 3 * 8 = 24 glasses if everything was consistent. However, we subtract the 2 glasses of water on Saturday night which brings us down to 24 - 2 = 22 glasses of water during the week. But remember, he made a fruit smoothie on one weekend, which isn't mentioned to contain water or not, so let's assume no additional glasses came out of it. Therefore, including Saturday night, John would still have consumed only 15 glasses of water plus the 2 extra, resulting in 17 glasses.
