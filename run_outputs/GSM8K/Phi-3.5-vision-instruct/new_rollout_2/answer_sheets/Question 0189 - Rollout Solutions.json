Calculate the total amount spent on tickets.\n2. Find out how much they spent on food.\n3. Add up the cost of the rides.\n4. Add everything together (tickets + food + rides).\n5. Divide the total sum by three since there are three friends.\n\nLet's start:\nStep 1: Tickets cost 20.25.\nStep 2: Food cost 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75.\nStep 3: Rides cost 2 * 33 = 66.\nStep 4: Total sum of expenses = 20.25 (tickets) + 15.75 (food) + 66 (rides) = 102.\nStep 5: Each friend pays 102 / 3 = 34.\n\nThe answer is: 34.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
