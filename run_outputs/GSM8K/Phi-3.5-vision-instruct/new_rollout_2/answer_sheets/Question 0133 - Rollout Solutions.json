On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which means he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles. We know his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles from Monday and Tuesday from the total miles (41). That leaves us with 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.
