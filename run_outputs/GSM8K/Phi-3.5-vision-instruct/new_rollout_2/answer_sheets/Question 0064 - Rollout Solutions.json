Sophia's tank initially held 12 gallons and she used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. This means her tank now holds 8 gallons (12 - 4). Since she doesn't want to use any of this remaining gas but just wants to find out the distance she could go if she were to use all of its contents as her own car gets 30 miles per gallon, we multiply the current gas level by the mileage per gallon which equals 8 * 30 = 240 miles.
