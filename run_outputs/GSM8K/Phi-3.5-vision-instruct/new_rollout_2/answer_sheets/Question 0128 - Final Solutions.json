First, let's find out the prices of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges based on their relationships:\n\nWatermelon price = 3 * Pepper price (since each watermelon costs three times as much)\nOranges cost = Watermelon cost - 5\n\nDillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, so using the hint provided, each watermelon costs $45, making the total cost for the watermelons 4 * $45 = $180. Since peppers cost $15 each, the next part is straightforward without needing further calculation:\nPeppers cost: 20 * $15 = $300.\n\nFinally, we use the relationship between oranges and watermelons:\nOranges cost = Watermelon cost ($45) - 5 = $40 each. Therefore, 10 oranges would cost 10 * $40 = $400.\n\nNow we add all these amounts together to find the total expenditure: $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.
