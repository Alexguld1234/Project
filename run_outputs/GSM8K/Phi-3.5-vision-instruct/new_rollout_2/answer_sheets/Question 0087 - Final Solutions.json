If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?

Sylvie starts with a salary of $600 per month or $600 * 12 months = $7200 annually. Her salary increases by 10%, which is $7200 * 0.10 = $720. Over 5 years, this results in an increase of $720 * 5 = $3600. After being in the company for 5 years, her increased salary is $7200 + $3600 = $10800.\n\nAfter working for another 3 years (which means it\u2019s been 8 years), we need to calculate another salary increase based on her original salary plus the 10% incremental raise. That would mean another $720 increase over these next 3 years, so add up the two increments, $3600 + $720 = $4320. Her new salary becomes $10800 + $4320 = $15120.\n\nSylvie's annual salary after three more years is therefore $15120.\n\nHer colleague earns $700 per month or $700 * 12 = $8400 annually. Given the identical percentage increase policy as Sylvie, their annual salary also grows by 10%. Hence, the colleague's current annual salary can be calculated using similar steps. This results in a 10% annual raise amounting to $8400 * 0.10 = $840 extra.

Firstly, let's find out how much Sylvie gets annually before the raise. She gets paid $600/month which means $600 x 12 months = $7200 per year. Since Sylvie works 5 years without raises yet, we need to account for this period first. Her new annual salary would therefore be (1.1^5) x $7200 because of the compounded interest effect over these 5 years. Next, let\u2019s see how much she gets each year from the sixth year onward due to the yearly increase of 10%. This can be calculated as (1.1^n) x $7200, where n represents the remaining number of years. Given that she'll work 3 more years after reaching 5 years of service, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years will be [(1.1^6) - (1.1^5)] x $7200 because it includes both the raises during the fifth year but not including the raise in the sixth year when calculating the difference between her seventh and eighth salaries. We also know her colleague makes $700/month so their annual pay is $700 x 12 = $8400. Her colleague doesn't receive any extra since their pay structure remains constant throughout all years. Hence, the final piece of information needed here would be the exact salary increment rate applied to Sylvie\u2019s coworker if required; however, since no such detail was provided about them, we cannot determine or compare Sylvie's salary directly with her colleague based solely on the current data.
