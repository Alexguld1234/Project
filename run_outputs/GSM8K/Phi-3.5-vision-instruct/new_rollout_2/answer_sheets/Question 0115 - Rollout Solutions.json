Since prices went up 50%, we need to find out what the new costs would be for both types of boards before adding them together.\nFor the smaller boards (2x4x10): New price = 100% (initial) + 50% (increase) = 150%. Thus, the new price per board is 10 * 1.5 = $15. Total cost = 15 * 10 = $150.\nFor the larger boards (4x4x10): New price = 160% (initial) + 50% (increase) = 210%. Thus, the new price per board is 16 * 1.5 = $24. Total cost = 24 * 5 = $120.\nAdding these values together, 150 + 120 = $270.
