Firstly, we calculate the total area covered by pineapple plants which would be 10 hectares multiplied by 100 pineapples per hectare, yielding 1000 pineapples as one harvest cycle (which equals three months). Since a full year consists of four such periods (3 months), John could theoretically harvest 1000 pineapples times 4 cycles. Thus, he would harvest 4000 pineapples in a year.
