First, we need to find out how many cookies Henry intended to bake before he made the mistake. We know that after the drop, he ended up with 110 cookies. To get back one cookie, it would mean he lost 110 - 100 = 10 cookies due to him not dropping any. But he also dropped 5 cookies intentionally, so if he hadn't dropped those, he would have ended up with 110 + 5 = 115 cookies. That means he accidentally dropped enough cookies to offset both the mistake and the loss from his brother. Since he made 15 extra cookies (which caused the overage), this implies that the original amount before these errors equaled 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. However, we still need to account for the fact that his brother took away 3 cookies. So, Henry initially planned to have 100 + 3 = 103 cookies to start off with. This suggests that since Henry wanted to double what he made last year, he planned to make 103 / 2 = 51.5 cookies last year; however, as you can\u2019t half a cookie, rounding down makes sense, meaning he aimed to bake 51 cookies. The answer is: 51.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
