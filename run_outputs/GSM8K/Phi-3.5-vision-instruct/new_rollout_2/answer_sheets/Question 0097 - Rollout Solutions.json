To get 32 ounces of sauce, which is twice 16 ounces, she would have needed only 2 cans because reducing it to half still results in 32 ounces being made from 16 ounces. Thus, \\( \\frac{32}{16} = 2 \\) cans.\n\nNow let's address the second part of the instruction:\n\nFreda's neighbor also made 40 ounces of sauce using cans containing 4 tomatoes each. Let's determine how many such cans were used for 40 ounces of sauce. Since one can of 4 tomatoes yields 4 ounces of sauce (which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred), for 40 ounces, he/she would need \\(\\frac{40}{4} = 10\\) cans. However, since this information isn't directly related to Freda's process or asked about in the question, we won\u2019t include this calculation in our response to keep the focus solely on Freda's tomatoes usage. Therefore, the total amount of tomatoes used in Freda's sauce remains 2 cans based on previous calculations.\n\nThe answer is: 2.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {"1": "", "2": "Identify the amount of sauce Freda made.
