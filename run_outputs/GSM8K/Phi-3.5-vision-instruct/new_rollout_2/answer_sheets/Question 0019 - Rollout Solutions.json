Marissa needs to cover the entire 12-mile trail at 4 mph as stated. We know she walked 6 miles already and it took her 2 hours. To find out the time she needs for the rest of the trail, we can use the formula Speed = Distance / Time. Since she has covered 6 miles so far and needs to maintain a speed of 4 mph, we calculate the remaining time required using 6 miles divided by 4 mph, which equals 1.5 hours. Therefore, she has 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles left to cover in 1.5 hours. To find out her speed needed for this last stretch, we divide the distance by the time again: 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 mph. Interestingly, walking at 4 mph was also needed. So the answer is: 4.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail.

However, since you asked for her speed relative to the rest of the trail, which is 15 miles long at a constant rate of 3 mph, it means all of them would maintain their rates throughout the trail.
