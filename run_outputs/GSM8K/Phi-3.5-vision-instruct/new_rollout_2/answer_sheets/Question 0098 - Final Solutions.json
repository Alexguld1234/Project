Then, 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes, but since we know 5 cars took an exit before the 15 minutes ended and 10 new cars joined, these would not affect the initial count of cars driving through the first 15 minutes because those events happened later than the first part of the 15-minute interval. Therefore, regardless of what happens after the first 15 minutes or who leaves due to exits or joining the queue, only the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam during the first half hour can change. Given this, if 'x' represents the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, it cannot increase nor decrease based on events happening outside of that specific timeframe mentioned. Hence, without additional information about any cars leaving or joining specifically during those first 15 minutes, we are unable to provide the exact figure for 'x'.
