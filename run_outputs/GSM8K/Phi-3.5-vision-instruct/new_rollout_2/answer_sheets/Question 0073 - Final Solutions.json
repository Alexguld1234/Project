Firstly, let's calculate the cost per cell phone including interest for both Shiela's and her friend's purchases. For Shiela: Each cell phone costs $150. With a 2% interest, it's an additional $150 * 0.02 = $3 extra per phone. Therefore, one cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $153. For six cell phones (since she buys five), it would be 153 * 5 = $765. Since this is spread over three months, Shiela pays $765 / 3 \u2248 $255 each month. For her friend: Each cell phone costs $200 plus a 1% interest, which means an additional $200 * 0.01 = $2 extra per phone. Thus, one cell phone costs $200 + $2 = $202. Four cell phones would therefore cost 202 * 4 = $808. Split across three months, her friend pays $808 / 3 \u2248 $269 each month.
