Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he needs 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since a pack contains 4 yogurts and costs $5, we first find out how many packs he needs: 60 / 4 = 15 packs. Each pack costs $5, so Terry spends 15 * $5 = $75 over 30 days. His brother also eats 3 yogurts a day but buys them separately, so we don't know exactly what he pays. Therefore, only Terry's cost can be determined confidently. The answer is: $75.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
