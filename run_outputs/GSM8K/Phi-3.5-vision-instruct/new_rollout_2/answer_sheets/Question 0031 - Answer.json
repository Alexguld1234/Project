{"id": 31, "problem": "Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half the first one. A third says 25% more than the first one. Meanwhile, a fourth friend guesses twice the first one's guess. What is their average guess?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The second person guessed 60 because 20 + (80/2)= <<20+(80/2)=60>>60\nThe third guessed 100 because 80 x 1.25 = <<80*1.25=100>>100\nThe fourth guessed 160 because 2 x 80 = <<2*80=160>>160\nThe total amount guessed is 80 + 60 + 100 + 160 = <<80+60+100+160=400>>400\nThe average amount guessed is 400 / 4 = <<400/4=100>>100\n#### 100", "gold_answer": "100"}
