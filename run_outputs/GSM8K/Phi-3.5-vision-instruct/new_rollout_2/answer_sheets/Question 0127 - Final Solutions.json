Therefore, since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we add these extra friends to find out how many friends Amy made. So 50 (Lily's friends) + 20 (extra friends Lily made), which equals 70 friends. To get the combined total of both girls' friends, we add Lily's friends to Amy's friends: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends). So 50 + 70 equals 120 friends in total.
