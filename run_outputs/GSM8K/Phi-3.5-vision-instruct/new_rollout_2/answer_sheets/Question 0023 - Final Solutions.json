First, we need to calculate how long both candles have been burning. They both started at 1:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM, which means they have been burning for 5 hours.\n\nNow let's see who melted less over those 5 hours. The first candle melts 2 cm/hour, while the second one melts 3 cm/hour. Over 5 hours, the first candle would have melted (2 cm/hour) * 5 hours = 10 centimeters, whereas the second candle would have melted (3 cm/hour) * 5 hours = 15 centimeters.\n\nSo the difference in melted amount between the two candles is: |15 - 10| = 5 centimeters. The answer is: 5.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns.

First, let's calculate how long both candles were lit together, which was from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
