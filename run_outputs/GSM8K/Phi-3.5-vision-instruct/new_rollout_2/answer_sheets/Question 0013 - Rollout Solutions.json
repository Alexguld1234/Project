We can set up the equation as follows:\n((2/3)V - 2)/2 = 5\nNow we need to solve for V. First, multiply both sides by 2:\n(2/3)V - 2 = 10\nThen add 2 to both sides:\n(2/3)V = 12\nNext, divide both sides by 2/3:\nV = 12 / (2/3)\nTo divide by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal, so we get:\nV = 12 * (3/2)\nWhich simplifies down to:\nV = 18\nThe hint also tells us that Melanie's colleague sold twice as many vacuums at the green house as Melanie, which means Melanie's colleague sold 2*(1/3)*V at the green house. Given that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, let's find out how many her colleague sold before reaching the same amount Melanie has left. Since Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners and ended with 5 after all transactions, her colleague also started with 18 vacuum cleaners and finished with 5 too because they made similar transactions until they reached their respective amounts of vacuum cleaners. This confirms our calculation that Melanie initially started with 18 vacuum cleaners.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
