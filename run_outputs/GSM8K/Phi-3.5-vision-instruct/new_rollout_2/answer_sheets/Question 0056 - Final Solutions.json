This means Peter can purchase three full sets of movies and popcorn within his budget without considering additional expenses. Now, comparing Peter's case with his friend's, who purchases a ticket and a snack each visit, we see that Peter could only afford four visits whereas his friend could manage to go two times within their shared funds due to higher individual costs associated with snacks.
