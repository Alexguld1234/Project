This equals 40 * 10 = $400. Now we need to figure out her overtime pay. Since Eliza worked 45 hours, she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 - 40). Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so for those overtime hours, she gets paid 1.2 * 10 = $12 per hour. Overtime earnings for 5 hours would thus equal 5 * 12 = $60. To find out how much she earned overall for the week, add her base earnings ($400) to her overtime earnings ($60), resulting in 400 + 60 = $460. Therefore, compared to Greg who earns $15/hour, if both work full time, their combined earnings would not change as their working hours differ only slightly but Greg's additional earnings due to his extra 5 hours make up for about $10 of difference based on their respective rates, leaving them almost equal. However, since Greg works more than one hour more than Eliza, which equates to an additional 5 hours, his earning advantage grows larger.
