First, we find out how many bees return in the first half hour (which would be 30 divided by 2). That's 15 bees. Next, we calculate how many bees the bird causes to leave, which is double the number that initially left, making it 60 bees. We subtract the number of bees that returned early (15) from the new number of bees that left because of the bird (60), which equals a net loss of 45 bees. However, since all bees that left didn't yet return, we don't add any additional bees back into the count. Therefore, only those 45 bees left permanently because of the bird landing.

Initially, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive. Then she sees half that amount (15) returning. Next, twice the initial number leaves again, which means 30 * 2 = 60 bees. Since all these bees would have left if none returned, we can subtract them from the total initially seen leaving. But since some also returned earlier, let\u2019s figure out who was still gone when those 60 bees left. We know only 30 initially left, so 30 bees were accounted for by both the first group that left and the ones that came back. This implies that the remaining 30 bees didn't leave during the last period. Therefore, all 30 bees that remained throughout this entire process returned to the hive in the second set of 6 hours.

However, considering what happened previously, not all 60 bees left; 30 had already flown off. Thus, everyone who had left was already taken into account. Hence, the rest of the bees, i.e., the 30 that didn't leave yet, eventually flew away. This indicates that all the remaining 30 bees left during the last 6 hours.
