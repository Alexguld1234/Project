Therefore, insurance costs would be $1300 * 0.10 = $130.\n\nTo find out the total amount Janet paid, we need to combine the manufacturing costs (materials and labor) with the insurance:\nTotal payment = Manufacturing cost + Insurance cost = $1300 + $130 = $1430.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider her friend who bought a necklace. Her friend paid $2000 plus 5% tax for insurance which amounts to $2000 * 0.05 = $100. Adding this to the purchase price brings us to a grand total of $2000 + $100 = $2100.\n\nWhen compared to what Janet paid, it seems like her friend spent less despite having a higher initial price tag due to the lower percentage taken as insurance.

Firstly, Janet paid $500 for materials and $800 to the jeweler which sums up to $500 + $800 = $1300. That is before any fees or taxes. She then gets insurance worth 10% of ($1300), so she spends 10/100 * 1300 = $130 on insurance. Adding these amounts together gives us $1300 + $130 = $1430 as Janet\u2019s grand total expenses. \n\nOn the other hand, her friend pays 5% for insurance on a $2000 necklace, amounting to 5/100 * 2000 = $100. \n\nThe difference between what Janet spent and what her friend spent would therefore be $1430 (Janet\u2019s expenses) - $100 (her friend\u2019s additional costs) = $1330. \n\nThis is not directly relevant to answering the original question about how much Janet herself paid; rather, it provides context for understanding comparative financial expenditures.
