Calculate total costs per client: Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach ($2 each) and a pack of cloths ($5). So, 2*2 + 5 = $9 per client.\n\n2. Calculate total costs based on the number of clients: Kim initially has 3 clients (his original ones), and may add 5 more which would bring him to 3+5 = 8 clients if accepted. Let's calculate costs for both scenarios.\n\n   a. 3 clients: Cost = 3*9 = $27\n   b. 8 clients: Cost = 8*9 = $72\n\nNow we know that Kim\u2019s total income will be $92 no matter the size of his client base. This means the profits can range depending upon his expenses. Therefore, we subtract these costs from his total income.\n\nProfit = Total Income - Total Expenses\n\nFor scenario one (3 clients):\nProfit_3_clients = 92 - 27 = $65\n\nFor scenario two (8 clients):\nProfit_8_clients = 92 - 72 = $20\n\nGiven that the hint states the cost of a pack of cloths doesn't change and thus the cost isn't dependent on the number of clients, we take the lower amount since adding clients didn't increase the total cost according to the information provided.
