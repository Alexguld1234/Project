He spent $200 on them and each costs $40. To find this, divide 200 by 40, which equals 5 blue ties. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie, meaning 50/100 * $40 = $20 more per red tie. Thus, the red ties cost $60 each. As for his friend, since he bought 6 red ties at the same price, his friend spent 6 * $60 = $360 on red ties.

First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40, and he spent $200 in total on blue ties, he bought $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.\n\nNext, let's determine how many red ties he bought. As stated before, since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ones, he got 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. \n\nNow, let's add up what he spent on both types of ties. The cost of the blue ties is $200 (as mentioned). The cost of the red ties needs to be calculated based on their individual prices. \n\nEach red tie is priced 50% higher than a blue tie, making it $40 * 1.5 = $60. Therefore, for 10 red ties, John would have paid 10 * $60 = $600.\n\nAdding these amounts together, John spent $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800 on ties altogether.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
