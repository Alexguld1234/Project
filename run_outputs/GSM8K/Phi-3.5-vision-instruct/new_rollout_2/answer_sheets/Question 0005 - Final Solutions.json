Each full price glass costs $5, so 16 glasses would normally cost 16 * $5 = $80. Since half of the glasses get a 60% discount, 8 glasses will have this offer. This means the cost for these discounted glasses is 8 * ($5 * (1 - 0.6)) = 8 * $2 = $16. Therefore, the total cost of all glasses is $80 - $16 = $64.
