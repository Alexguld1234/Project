First, calculate the amount of water in the orange drink before any spills or additions. Two-thirds of 10 liters is (2/3) * 10 = 6.67 liters. Add this to the initial 6.67 liters of water in the pineapple drink, you get 6.67 + 6.67 = 13.34 liters. One liter was spilled during mixing, so we subtract that: 13.34 - 1 = 12.34 liters. After adding the 8 liters of lemonade, which contains half water (4 liters), the new volume is 24 liters. We need to find out how much of the mixture is water. Since the pineapple drink had already 6.67 liters and the first addition was 12.34 liters, our calculation doesn't account for all of these, only the lemonade.

Then considering the loss due to spillage, this results in 14.67 liters remaining. When you consider the addition of 8 liters of lemonade into the mixture, since it is made up of half water, this would mean only half of these 8 liters contribute to the water content. So, 8 / 2 = 4 liters of water come from the lemonade.
