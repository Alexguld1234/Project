Firstly, let's calculate the total revenue without considering profit or loss. We know that every gallon is sold for $10. Juan and Carlos aimed to make $25, but since making just one gallon would not achieve even $25, they needed to produce enough gallons to surpass this figure. Let\u2019s assume they produced 'n' gallons; thus, their total revenue would be $10n. Since the profit was $25, the equation to find out spending on lemons (cost of goods sold - total revenue) is: \n\nCost of Goods Sold = Total Revenue + Profit\nSpending on Lemons = Total Costs - Revenue - Profit\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold = Cost of Lemons + Cost of Sugar\nWe don't know how many sugars were used, as it doesn't directly affect the calculation related to lemon expense. Therefore, we can ignore the sugars for now. With profits being $25, the revenue plus the profit equals twice the spending on lemons because costs before profit is equal to revenue. Thus, if we denote the total cost on lemons as L, our equation looks like this:\n\nL + Profit = 2L + Total Sales\nGiven that the Profit is $25 and Total Sales through lemons alone must be less than $25 / 2 which is $12.50 (as individual sales cannot be higher due to profit margin constraints):\n$25 (Profit) + Total Sales = 2L + Total Sales\nL + $25 = 2L\nTo solve for L (the total cost of lemons), subtract L from both sides:\nL + $25 - L = 2L - L\n$25 = L\nThus, the answer is: $25.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade.
