When we add up both amounts of money she received over these two periods (from her sibling and her own allowance), it equals $100.

We know Bailey's sibling got $60 from their allowance over 6 weeks. Bailey also received $40 from her allowance alone during those same 6 weeks. Combining both amounts, you get $60 + $40 = $100. Since Bailey had no initial amount mentioned, let's assume she didn't have any money before receiving her weekly allowances, meaning she only had her allowances. Therefore, Bailey started with $0 since all her money came from her allowance. The hint provided can simply help us verify the math behind her total income but doesn't affect the fact that she likely began with no extra money. However, considering this hint, we could solve for X without the assumption\u2014it would yield the same result, confirming that Bailey probably started with $0 because the sum of $100 includes just her allowances.
