But remember, we used an approximation due to the hint about rounding; however, the exact age isn't necessary when calculating the difference in future ages according to the question's conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the information provided and respecting typical integer values for age calculations without fractions, Brooke's actual age could be rounded up to 8 years, which makes Seth exactly 16 years old right now.

But since age cannot be a fraction, it means Brooke would need to be around 8 when rounding down, because if we rounded up to 9, adding double her age plus 1 wouldn't reach 28 even without considering our initial subtraction error caused by not correctly calculating Brooke's age. To recalculate using accurate whole numbers: Seth needs to be twice as old as Brooke, so if Brooke is 8, then Seth is 16. In two years, Brooke will be 10 and Seth will be 18. Their combined age will indeed be 28. However, since the hint implies that only integer values make sense for age, we might assume there was an error in our earlier calculations.
