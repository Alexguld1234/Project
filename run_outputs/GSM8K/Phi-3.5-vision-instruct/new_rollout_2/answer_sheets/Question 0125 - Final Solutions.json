Given that Julia used 3 spoons from the package for testing purposes, it seems reasonable to conclude that she had at least 15 - 3 = 12 extra spoons beyond what she would have otherwise anticipated without such an interruption. Hence, considering both instances \u2013 one just before cooking and another momentary shortage due to the interruption \u2013 she must have purchased enough spoons so that even with 3 removed for taste testing, she ended up with exactly 12 spoons ready for table setting.
