First, let's calculate the weekly class hours for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Kimo has 3 hours of class on each of these days (3 * 1 = 3), which totals 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days. Next, we consider Tuesdays and Thursdays when he has two 2-hour classes each day (2 * 2 = 4 hours per day). Since he has this schedule twice a week, it adds another 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 9 hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday plus 8 hours on Tuesday and Thursday each week. Adding them together gives us 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week. Multiplying this weekly attendance time by the 16 weeks in the semester gives us 17 * 16 = 272 hours spent attending classes during the semester.
