For Tim, being 2 miles away means he covers 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet, or 10560 / 440 = 24 minutes using his car.\n\nNow, considering that Steve gets delayed due to the cat chasing him, but only speeds up temporarily and not enough to catch up, the winner would still be the one whose house is closer because they spend less time commuting. Therefore, Tim would win as he arrives earlier than Steve.\n\nSo, Steve waits 36 minutes while Tim waits 24 minutes. The difference between them is 36 - 24 = 12 minutes.
