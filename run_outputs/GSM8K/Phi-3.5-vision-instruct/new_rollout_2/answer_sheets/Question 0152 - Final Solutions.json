With 10 packs at $0.10 each, we multiply 10 (packs) by $0.10 which equals $1.00 per pack times 10 packs, therefore, the total cost would be $10.00. However, since it states that each pack costs $0.10, it seems there might be an error because at one pack at $0.10 would only cost 10 cents, not $1.00. Let's assume this was intended to say $0.10 instead of the previous assumption of $1.00 per pack. Therefore, Carl spent $1.00 times 10 packs, equaling $10.00. Since he used a $10 bill, subtract the total cost from the $10 bill he gave: $10.00 - $10.00 = $0.00.

Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies Carl bought. Each pack costs $1.00 and he bought 10 packs. That means 10 packs x $1.00/pack = $10.00 Total. Secondly, Carl paid with a $10 bill which should be enough since the total price was exactly $10.00.
