Brittany's phone contains some photos she took of a school event last week.

Jamal's phone holds 1800 photographs which is 6 times what Brittany's phone holds. So, Brittany's phone holds 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs. This is also equal to the number of birds multiplied by 50. So, we need to divide 300 by 50 to find out the number of birds (birdies). 300 / 50 is 6. Since this calculation was based on Brittany's phone capacity being equivalent to the number of birds multiplied by 50, it confirms our previous hint about there being 6 birds or ducks in Jamal's photograph.
