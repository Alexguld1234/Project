We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can call the number of baby bees B. Since there are twice as many babies as queens, we can say there are B/2 queens. Together, this means there are B (baby) + B (worker) + B/2 (queen). Given 700 bees total, our equation is B + 2B + B/2 = 700. Simplifying, we get 3.5B = 700, which means B = 200.
