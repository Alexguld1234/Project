[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price.

That results in 8 glasses costing fully and 8 glasses costing 60% of their original price. The answer is 8 fully priced glasses and 8 discounted glasses.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much does Kylar need to pay for the glasses?", "subanswer": {"text": "Full-priced glasses cost $5 each, so 8 glasses would cost 8 * $5 = $40. Discounted glasses cost 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3 per glass. So 8 discounted glasses would cost 8 * $3 = $24. Adding both amounts together, Kylar needs to pay $40 + $24 = $64.
