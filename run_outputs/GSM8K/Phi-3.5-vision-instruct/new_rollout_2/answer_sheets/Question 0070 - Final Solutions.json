They teach 4 classes per weekday, which is 4 classes/day * 5 days/week = 20 classes. Plus 6 classes on Saturday equals 26 classes per week.

At $15 per student, she makes 495 * $15 = $7425.\n\nFor her colleague who teaches less often but fewer classes:\nHer colleague teaches 4 classes per weekday, which is 4 * 5 = 20 classes, and she also teaches 6 classes on Saturday. This totals to 20 + 6 = 26 classes in a week. Each class has 15 students, therefore 15 * 26 = 390 students over a week.
