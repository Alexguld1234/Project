Thus, if we assume all coins except the penny are quarters, since four quarters equal 1 dollar, four quarters add up to another dollar, so the best assumption here is that two of the coins are quarters and the third is a nickel. Two quarters (each being worth 25 cents) thus equal 50 cents while one nickel adds 5 cents resulting in 55 cents; however, considering only 3 cents are needed to reach the target, we have to revise our assumptions. Given that we need just 3 cents out of the total 3 cents available across the three coins, and we cannot afford any additional coins unless we discard the previous reasoning entirely due to the fact that adding even a second quarter would exceed the limit, let's reconsider the combination of coins. If we include a penny for sure\u2014because it fits within the budget\u2014and combine it with two nickels (which also add up correctly to 3 cents), we achieve precisely the correct total without breaching the limit.
