Next, we find out how many letters are in 'YEAR', excluding spaces or punctuation. That would be Y + E + A + R = 4. Then, since it doesn't mention any specific value for angles in a pentagon, let's assume the average angle measure used in calculations could be taken as pi, commonly known to be approximately 3.14.\n\nNow we multiply the digit count (4) by the average angle measure in degrees (let's take pi as 3.14), so our current calculation looks like 4 * 3.14. Finally, subtract the letter count in 'MONTH', which is M+O+N+T+H=5.\n\nSo the full equation is 4 * \u03c0 - 5.\n\nSince \u03c0 is an irrational number, if we round it to three decimal places, 3.14, our calculation becomes 4 * 3.14 - 5. This equals 12.56 - 5, which equals 7.56. However, since the question doesn't specify the use of an approximate value for \u03c0, let\u2019s leave it as is without rounding for exactness.
