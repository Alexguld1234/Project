Firstly, we identify the number of letters in both words. Both 'CAT' and 'AT' contain 2 letters each. The first instruction tells us to double the number of letters in 'CAT', which is 3 (the original count) times 2. Thus, we calculate 3 x 2 = 6. Next, according to the second part of the instructions, we subtract the number of letters in 'AT' from this new total. Since both 'AT' and 'CAT' consist of 2 letters, the difference remains constant regardless of the initial quantity being doubled or not. Therefore, 6 - 2 equals 4.
