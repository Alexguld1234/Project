According to Definition 1 (A rectangle), each angle measures 90 degrees because all sides are parallel lines. Thus, a rectangle has four equal angles, which means it has 4 angles in total. From Definition 2 (A triangle), we know every angle in a triangle equals less than or equal to 180 degrees but since no specific values are provided beyond equality amongst its angles, we can assume a triangle also consists of exactly 3 angles as per its properties.
