First, we need to identify the lengths of both words according to our condition. Both 'SUN' and 'MOON' have 4 letters each. Now we can use the hint provided which states that 4 multiplied by 6 equals 24. The product of the lengths of these two words would also be calculated based on this hint; therefore, we get 4 (length of 'SUN') multiplied by 6 (length of 'MOON'), resulting in a total of 24.
