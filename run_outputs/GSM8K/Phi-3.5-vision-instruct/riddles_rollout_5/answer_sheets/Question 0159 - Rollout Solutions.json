First, we multiply the number of chapters in a trilogy (which is 30 because each book has 10 chapters) by the number of letters in 'BOOK', which is 4. That gives us 30 * 4 = 120. We know humans typically have one nose per face, but since this instruction asks for division by the number of noses on three human faces, it implies using numbers larger than one. However, as 'nosies' isn't recognized in standard mathematics or English dictionaries, let's proceed under the assumption that 'nosies' refers to 3 human faces having one nose apiece. Dividing our result by 3 would mean 120 / 3 = 40. Without clarification about what 'noses' might refer to mathematically, we can only divide by the number explicitly provided.
