A tricycle has 3 wheels and an airplane has 2 wings. So when we divide the number of wheels (3) by the number of wings (2), it goes like this: 3 \u00f7 2 = 1.5. But since you can't really have half a wheel or wing, let's just consider whole numbers only. Thus, if we were counting whole things such as wheels and wings separately, the result would not make practical sense because neither can truly be divided evenly into this scenario. However, mathematically, dividing 3 by 2 gets us a result of 1.5.
