Firstly, let's calculate the letters in 'PHENOMENOON' and subtract those in 'ENCYCLOPEDIA'.

Thus, 'PHENOMENOON' has 5 unique letters without considering the repetitions. 'ENCYCLOPEDIA' also has 5 unique letters because no other letters are shared.\n\nNow, adding up all these letters results in 5 letters from 'PHENOMENOON' + 5 unique letters from 'ENCYCLOPEDIA' which totals to 10.
