We determined earlier that there are 6 vowels in 'EDIBLE', thus the calculation will look like this: 6 * S where S represents the positional value of the letter 'S' within the string 'MISSISSIPPI'. Since 'S' appears once in 'MISSISSIPPI', its positional value could theoretically represent itself if we follow an arbitrary assignment; however, typically when dealing with equations involving words, positions refer to character indices rather than their alphabetical place. Thus, assuming equal weighting between each character in our hypothetical equation, we assign the value 1 to each occurrence of 'S'. This results in 6 * 1 = 6. Next, we must subtract the number of legs on a single flamingo from this product. An adult flamingo has two legs, therefore subtracting 2 legs yields a remainder of 4. Hence, applying all conditions 3 and 4 leads us to conclude the final answer is 4.", "value": 0.25}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
