Each face of a cube shares its vertices with other faces. A cube has 6 faces, so if it has n vertices per face, then the total vertices would be 6n. Since each vertex is part of exactly three faces (one on each side), the sum of all vertices when counted once for each face is equal to 3n. Equating these expressions, we get 3n = 6n or n = 3. Therefore, a cube has 3 vertices per face times 6 faces, which equals 18 vertices in total. However, considering the hint provided, this might suggest an incorrect approach since a cube cannot actually have just 3 vertices; hence revisiting our original calculation confirms that a cube indeed has 8 vertices.

A cube has points where its edges intersect. Since every edge meets another at one point (except for corners), we can count them. Each face of a cube shares a side edge and has four corners.
