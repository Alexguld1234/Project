We know there are 2 days in a weekend, which represents Saturday and Sunday, and 5 weekdays in a week, representing Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. To find out the product, multiply these numbers together. So, multiplying the number of days in a weekend (2) by the number of weekdays in a week (5), you get 2 * 5 = 10 as the result.
