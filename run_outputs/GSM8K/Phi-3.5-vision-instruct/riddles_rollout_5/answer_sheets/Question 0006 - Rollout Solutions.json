Since one coin is already accounted for (a penny), what remains are two more coins.

You know you have a penny which equals 1 cent. Since your three coins together equal 3 cents, and we already know you have a penny, it means that all other two coins also make up 3 - 1 = 2 cents in total. Each coin makes up half this amount so each of those two coins would be worth 2 / 2 = 1 cent.
