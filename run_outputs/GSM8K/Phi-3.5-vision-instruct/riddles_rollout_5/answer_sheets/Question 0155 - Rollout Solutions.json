According to the hint, we're instructed to multiply 2022 (the year) by itself, but we cannot execute the actual calculation due to lacking clarity on the multiplier. However, following the hint suggests understanding that without further contextual data indicating otherwise, one might proceed to perform unnecessary mathematical operations since it doesn't affect the outcome if both factors are identical. Therefore, assuming standard arithmetic rules apply here, even though they aren't explicitly stated, doing anything like this isn't beneficial as per the problem statement.
