Firstly, count all the consonants in 'TRANSFORMATION': T-R-N-S-F-R-M-T-N-S-F-R-M which totals up to 13. Secondly, find out how many vowels are in 'MATHEMATICAL': A-A-E-I-A which totals up to 4. Subtract the number of vowels (4) from the sum of letters (13): 13 - 4 = 9. Thirdly, since each human has 10 toes, multiply our previous result by 10: 9 * 10 = 90. Lastly, we need to add the smallest prime numbers below 5, but since it's specified as \"<\" rather than \"<=\" or \">\", let us skip those as any non-zero positive integer would technically fit into this category. Therefore, since no small primes like 2 or 3 can be included due to their absence, our calculation doesn't change. Thus, the final answer remains unaffected by including these primes because of our exclusion criteria.
