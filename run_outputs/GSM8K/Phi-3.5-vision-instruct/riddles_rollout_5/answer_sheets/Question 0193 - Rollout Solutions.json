Calculate the total hours over the 5 days which we already converted into minutes using Hint 1; thus, the result remains 7200 minutes.\n2. Divide these 7200 minutes by the number of unique prime digits used in counting them. Since all numbers greater than 1 use only one digit, our divisor will simply be the distinct single digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This results in \\( 7200 \\div 9 = 800 \\) minutes when considering just those digits.\n3. Next, consider the letter counts in 'EDIFICATION': E=1, D=1, I=2, F=1, A=1, C=1, T=1, I=1, N=1.
