First, we need to find out how many finger pairs can be made on both hands combined. Since there are 10 fingers in total across both hands, we first divide this by 2 because each hand has 5 fingers. This gives us 10 / 2 = 5 finger pairs. Each pair represents an elbow since there is one elbow per hand. Therefore, if you divide the number of finger pairs (which equals the number of elbows) which is 5, by itself, it remains 5. The hint confirms our calculation as correct.
