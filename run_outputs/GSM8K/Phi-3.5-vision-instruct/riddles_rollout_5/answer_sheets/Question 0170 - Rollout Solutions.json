First, we need to find all the consonants in 'COMPUTATIONAL' which are C, M, P, T, N, L, S, B, T, A, N, L. Counting them up we get 12 consonants. Next, let's look at 'ALGORITHM'. We remove all its vowels (A, I) leaving us with ALGRSHTM, which counts as 7 non-vowel characters. Now multiply this result by wheels on a car. Cars typically come with four wheels so 7 * 4 equals 28.
