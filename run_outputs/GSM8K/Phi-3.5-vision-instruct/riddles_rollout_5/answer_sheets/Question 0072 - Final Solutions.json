Following this instruction, we take note of the fact that 'the number of rings in the Olympic symbol' refers to a countable object, namely the five interlinked rings displayed prominently on the Olympics' official logo. Similarly, when it comes to musical instruments like a flute\u2014a woodwind instrument popularized during the Renaissance period as well as widely used across various genres even into modern times\u2014there typically exists a set design that includes six holes through which sound is produced via the embouchure technique or finger placements along its body length.
