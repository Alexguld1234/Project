We know that there are 7 days in a week. Since we want to find out about a fortnight which consists of 14 days, it is like saying two weeks combined together. Therefore, if you start with the number of days in a week (7), you can calculate the number of days in a fortnight by multiplying 7 by 2, getting 14. Subtracting this new value from our original starting point of 7, we get 7 - 14 = -7. However, since a negative amount doesn't make sense in this context, the hint tells us that we don't really need any further calculations here, because subtracting zero results in subtraction itself.
