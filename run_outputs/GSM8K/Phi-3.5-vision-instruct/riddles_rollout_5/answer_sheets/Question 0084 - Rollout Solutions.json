A standard bass guitar has 4 strings. However, it is highly unlikely that a typical skateboard would have any relation to this as skateboards generally don\u2019t have strings or even similar objects like wheels; instead, they typically feature trucks attached to the board which help guide its movement but not to provide any kind of musical value. Therefore, none of the provided options seems directly applicable to answering such a question since they all pertain only to string instruments specifically related to music production and performance. \n\nHowever, if we consider metaphorical aspects or analogies rather than literal ones, one could argue for Option B (No strings) because while physical features can vary among different models of skateboards, it is true that certain skateboards come without grip tape \u2013 sometimes referred to colloquially as having 'no strings'. This analogy aligns with our initial interpretation of skateboards being primarily concerned with their physical movement rather than musical instrumentation.
