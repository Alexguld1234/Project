Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. After the first part of the traffic jam, let's say X cars passed through. Then, another 20 cars went through later. Also, 5 cars took an exit. So we know that 30 - 5 = 25 cars were still in the line after those who took exits. This means that X (cars passing through) + 20 (additional cars passing through) equals 25 (cars still waiting). So, X + 20 = 25. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get X = 5. Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

We need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, without counting the 5 cars that took an exit. Since those 5 cars didn't drive through the jam, their departure means we subtract them from our total consideration. Therefore, if there were 30 original cars and we know 5 took an exit, this leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars eligible for traveling through the jam. If these 25 cars include both the ones who went through within the first 15 minutes as well as those who came later (which we can denote as X), and knowing that 20 cars traveled through in the second half of the jam, it seems reasonable to assume that all 20 cars that came later also passed through during the entire period. This makes the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam equal to 20 plus however many drove through initially; let\u2019s call this initial number Y. Thus, we establish that Y + 20 equals 25 because these add up to account for the whole 25 cars that actually completed the journey through the traffic jam. Solving for Y, we get Y = 25 - 20, which is Y = 5. However, based upon the hint provided and considering only those who moved, since 5 cars took exits, leaving just the rest to move forward, we must adjust our calculations accordingly. Therefore, the amount of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is Y, which equals 5.
