Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times (2 rides) which cost 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times (4 rides) which cost 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. Together, they used 12 + 24 = 36 tickets on the roller coaster. They both rode the luge twice (2 rides per person), so that's 2 * 6 = 12 tickets each. Adding their tickets together, we get 36 (roller coaster) + 12 (Luge) + 12 (Luge) = 60 tickets in total. The answer is: 60.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times.
