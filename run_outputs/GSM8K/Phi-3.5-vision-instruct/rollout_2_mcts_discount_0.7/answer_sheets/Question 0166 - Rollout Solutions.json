She gets 9 eggs from her neighbor for each babysitting job. Each round of babysitting will allow her to get 9 eggs (enough for 3 flans) but since she only makes 1 flan at a time, she effectively uses only 9 eggs per babysitting session. To find out how many sessions she needs for 15 flans, divide the needed number of flans by the number of flans made per session: 15 / 1 = 15 sessions. However, because she only uses part of the 9 eggs she receives for each session to make the flans, the number of times she actually has to babysit equals the total number of flans divided by the number of flans that fit in her egg supply per session, or 15 / 3 = 5 babysitting sessions.
