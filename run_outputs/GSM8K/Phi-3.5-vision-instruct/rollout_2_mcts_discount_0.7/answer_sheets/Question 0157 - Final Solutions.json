To find out how much farther the winner (Blake) ran compared to the loser (Kelly), we simply subtract the total distances: 1500 - 1650 = -150.

First, we need to calculate how far Blake ran. He ran back and forth 15 times over a 100 yard football field. That means 100 yards * 2 (for back and forth) * 15 rounds = 3000 yards. Next, let's find out how far Kelly ran. She made one complete round trip and then 34 additional trips to the 40-yard line before returning. The initial distance covered is 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards. She makes 34 additional trips but only goes halfway as if running all the way around, which would normally add another 50 yards per return journey. Since she only goes to halfway, those extra trips add just half of their normal distance. Half of 50 yards is 25 yards, making these 34 trips equal 25 yards + 25 yards = 50 yards per set, or 34 sets * 50 yards/set = 1700 yards. Adding the initial round trip of 200 yards, Kelly ran 1700 yards + 200 yards = 1900 yards. Subtracting Kelly's distance from Blake's distance, we get 3000 yards - 1900 yards.
