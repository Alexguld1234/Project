Let L be the number of games lost by the team. Therefore, the wins would be L + 8. Since the total games played was 22, we can write this as L + (L + 8) = 22. Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 2L = 14. Dividing by 2 gives us L = 7. That means they won L + 8, which equals 7 + 8 = 15 games.

Let L be the number of games the team lost. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so they won L + 8 games. Together, they played 22 games. Therefore, L (the losses) plus L + 8 (the wins) equals 22 games. We can write this as an equation: L + (L + 8) = 22. By solving this equation, we get 2L + 8 = 22.
