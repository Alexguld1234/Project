Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. First, let's see how much weight comes out when he takes away 30 comic books. Each comic book is 1/4 pound, so 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds. This means he can still take out 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds worth of toys. Since one toy is 1/2 pound, he would need to take out 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.
