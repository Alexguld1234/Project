First, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both types of products. Jewelry was expected to increase in value by 2.5%, which means its price could potentially increase to $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125. Electronic gadgets were expected to increase in value by 1.2%, meaning their price could potentially increase to $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096. To find out which product will provide greater profit, subtract the original cost from the increased cost for each item. With jewelry, it's $5,125 - $5,000 = $125. And for electronic gadgets, it's $8,096 - $8,000 = $96. Comparing these two figures shows that electronic gadgets offer a larger profit margin than jewelry over one month.
