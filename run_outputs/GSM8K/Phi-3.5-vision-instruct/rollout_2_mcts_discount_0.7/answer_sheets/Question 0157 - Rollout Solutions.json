Firstly, we need to calculate the distance Blake runs. Each time he goes back and forth one way across the field (100 yards), that's 200 yards per trip. With 15 trips, he runs 200 x 15 = 3000 yards.\n\nNext, let's find out how far Kelly runs. Firstly, running to the halfway point twice means she's going 100 yards each direction, totaling 200 yards per trip. Plus, she runs these 34 times which totals 200 x 34 = 6800 yards.\n\nComparing their distances, the winner (Blake) ran 3000 yards while the loser (Kelly) ran 6800 yards.
