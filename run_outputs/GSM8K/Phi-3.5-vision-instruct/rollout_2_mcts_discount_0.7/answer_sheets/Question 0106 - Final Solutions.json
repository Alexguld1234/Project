First, let's find the dimensions of each box without considering the thickness of the walls. We know that John's boxes have dimensions 5x6x4 inches (length, width, height). To find the inner dimension for each side, we need to subtract twice the wall thickness because it affects every face of the box. So, for length, we take 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches; for width, we use 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches; for height, we calculate 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches. These are the new measurements excluding the thickness of the walls. Next, we multiply these dimensions together to find the inner volume of one box: 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches per box. Since John has 3 identical boxes, we multiply the single box volume by 3: 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches. Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes combined would be 72 cubic inches.", "value": 0.84375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "John has 3 boxes.

First we find the new size of one box without the outer walls. Length becomes 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches. Width becomes 6 - 2*1 = 4 inches. Height becomes 4 - 2*1 = 2 inches. Next we calculate the internal volume of one box using these measurements: Volume = length x width x height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.
