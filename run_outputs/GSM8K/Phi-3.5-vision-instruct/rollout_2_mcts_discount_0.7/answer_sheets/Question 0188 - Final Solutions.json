First we need to find out the cost price per bag including transportation. It was $20 plus $2 which makes $22 per bag. If the trader made $400 as profit after selling at $30 each, this means he sold (30 - 22) = $8 worth of profits per bag. To make a profit of $400, the number of bags sold would therefore be $400 / $8 = 50 bags.

We know that each bag was sold for $30 and the total profit was $400. This means the revenue from selling x bags was $30 * x which equals $30x. Also, we can write the equation representing the profit as Revenue minus Cost Price equaling Profit: 30x - 22x = 400. This simplifies to 8x = 400. To find the value of x, divide both sides by 8, so x = 400 / 8 = 50. Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags.
