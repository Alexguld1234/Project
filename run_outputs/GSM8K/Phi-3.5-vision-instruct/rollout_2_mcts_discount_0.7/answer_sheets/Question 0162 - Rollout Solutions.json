The initial cost of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time it increases by 20%, which means it goes up by 20/100 * $20 = $4. Over 36 months (which is 18 cycles of 2 months), the increase would happen 18 times because 36 / 2 = 18. So over those 18 periods, the cost would go up 18 * $4 = $72. Adding this amount to the original cost, we get 20 + 72 = $92.
