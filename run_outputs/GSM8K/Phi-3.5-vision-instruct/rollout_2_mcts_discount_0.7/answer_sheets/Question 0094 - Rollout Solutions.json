Firstly, we need to find out the total number of rabbits. The hint says it's 12 less than the sum of dogs and cats, so we first calculate the combined amount of dogs and cats. Since there are twice as many cats as dogs, let's set D to represent the number of dogs, which is given as 60. Therefore C, representing the number of cats, would be 2D or 2*60=120. Adding these together gets us 60 (for dogs) + 120 (for cats) = 180. Subtracting 12, since the rabbit count is 12 fewer than this, results in 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits. Finally, adding all types together, 168 (rabbits) + 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats), we get 168 + 60 + 120 = 348 animals. The answer is: 348.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
