The fee per car tire is $40. On Thursday, the mechanic fixed 4 car tires, which means the revenue was 4 x $40 = $160. On Friday, the mechanic fixed 12 car tires, so the revenue would be 12 x $40 = $480. To find the total revenue over both days, we add up both revenues: $160 (Thursday) + $480 (Friday) = $640.

Firstly, calculate the revenue earned per day. On Thursday, the mechanic earned (6 tires * $60) + (4 tires * $40) = $360 + $160 = $520. On Friday, only car tires were repaired so the revenue was (12 tires * $40) = $480. To find out which day had more revenue, we compare the two amounts. $520 > $480. Therefore, the higher revenue was on Thursday. The difference can be calculated as $520 - $480 = $40. The answer is: $40.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
