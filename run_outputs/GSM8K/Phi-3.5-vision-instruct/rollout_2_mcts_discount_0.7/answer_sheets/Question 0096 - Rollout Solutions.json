Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which was 9 hours, we multiply 9 hours by 2/3. This equals 6 hours. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, subtract James's hours from Harry's hours. That is 9 - 6 = 3 hours. The hint helped us confirm our steps.

To find out how long James slept, we need to calculate 2/3 of Harry's sleeping time. That means 2/3 times 9 equals 6 hours (because 9 times 2/3 equals 6).
