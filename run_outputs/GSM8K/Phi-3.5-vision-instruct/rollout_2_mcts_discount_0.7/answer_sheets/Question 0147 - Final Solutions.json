She also saw twice that amount leaving again during the same 6 hour span, so that's another 30 bees (since 30 is doubled). First we add up the ones that left both times, which is 30 + 30 = 60 bees. However, since only half of these returned in the second set of six hours, we need to subtract them once because they are counted twice when adding up all who left in the first and second sets of six hours. Therefore, 60 - 30 leaves us with 30 bees remaining from the first group of departure. Now let's calculate the new number of bees leaving based on the original count, which was 30 bees in the first batch, but it says no actual bees have left yet, making it 0 for the current batch mentioned. We subtract the current batch of bees leaving, assuming none yet (0), and add back the half of previous batch that came back, thus it\u2019s 30 - 0 + 15 = 45 bees.
