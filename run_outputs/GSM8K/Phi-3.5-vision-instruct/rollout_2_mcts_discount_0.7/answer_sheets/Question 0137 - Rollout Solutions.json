First, we calculate the cost of the sub sandwiches without considering the additional fees or tips. Each sub costs $7.50, so two subs would normally cost 2 x $7.50 = $15.00.

Subs: $7.50 x 2 = $15. Chips: $1.50 x 2 = $3. Cookies: $1.00 x 2 = $2. Total: $15 (subs) + $3 (chips) + $2 (cookies) = $20.\n\nNext, figure out the additional charges. Delivery fee: 20% of $20 ($20 * 0.20 = $4). Add this to the original total ($20 + $4 = $24). Tip: $5.00. Add this too ($24 + $5 = $29).\n\nFinally, sum up everything for the grand total.
