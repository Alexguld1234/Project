Out of 20 cars, we know that 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, so these account for 12 + 4 = 16 cars. This leaves us with 20 - 16 = 4 semi-automatic cars. To find out what percentage this represents, divide the number of semi-automatic cars (4) by the total number of cars (20), and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
