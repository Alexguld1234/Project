First, convert the length of the rolls into feet. We know each roll is 4 inches long, which is 1/3 of a foot (since 12 inches make up 1 foot). Therefore, 300 rolls would be 300 * (1/3) = 100 feet. Next, add the length of the chocolate croissants and baguettes. Chocolate croissants are 120 * 6 inches, converted to feet, is 120 * (6/12) = 60 feet. Baguettes are 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet. Finally, add all three measurements together: 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.

Next, we need to convert the length of the chocolate croissants into the same units as before; since 1 foot equals 12 inches, each chocolate croissant is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long. This means 120 chocolate croissants would add up to 120 * 0.5 = 60 feet. Lastly, we consider the lengths of the baguettes, which are already in feet, so this does not require any conversion. We know there are 60 baguettes each being 2 feet long, hence adding another 60 * 2 = 120 feet. When combined, these three categories will sum up to 100 (rolls) + 60 (chocolate croissants) + 120 (baguettes), making a total of 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.
