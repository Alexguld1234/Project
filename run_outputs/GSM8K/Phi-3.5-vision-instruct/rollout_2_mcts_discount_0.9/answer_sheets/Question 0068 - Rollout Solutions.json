Firstly, we know there are twice as many boys as girls. Since there are 60 girls, there must be 2 * 60 = 120 boys. Adding the boys and girls together gives us 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students. Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by this ratio to find out the number of teachers. That would be 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?", "ost_step": {"1": "Since there are twice as many boys as girls, calculate the number of boys using the information about the girls.

We know there are 60 girls and we need to find out how many boys there are first since there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if 1 girl equals half a boy in terms of quantity (since there are twice as many boys), it means 1 girl equals 0.5 boys. Therefore, 60 girls would equal 60 * 0.5 = 30 boys. Now add them together for all the students: 60 girls + 30 boys = 90 students. Since there are 5 students per teacher, divide 90 by 5 to get 18 teachers. The hint doesn't seem right because I can't just assume there are twice as many boys as girls based on this problem description alone; therefore, my calculation was based purely on the provided numbers without assuming any relationships between the numbers of boys and girls. Thus, correcting the instructions and making use of both hints properly, let\u2019s recalculate it correctly.\n\nFirstly, according to your new guidance, we start by doubling the amount of girls to determine the boys count. Since there are 60 girls, doubled, you get 60 * 2 = 120 boys.\n\nNow adding up both boys and girls: 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students in total.\n\nAs you mentioned, there are 5 students for every teacher, so to find out the number of teachers, divide the total number of students by the student-to-teacher ratio. Hence, 180 students / 5 students/teacher = 36 teachers.\n\nThe corrected answer follows: The answer is: 36.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
