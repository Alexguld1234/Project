Combined, these cost $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nNow let's find out the increased cost: With the 50% price increase, the ten 2x4x10 boards now cost $10 + $5 = $15 each. And the five 4x4x10 boards still cost $16 each. The new combined cost is (10 * $15) + (5 * $16) = $150 + $80 = $230.\n\nTo determine her profit, we need to subtract the initial total cost from the new total cost: $230 - $180 = $50. The hint provided doesn't affect the calculation since we are only asked for the profits made when selling the existing inventory at its current value.

Ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each costs 10 * $10 = $100. Five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each costs 5 * $16 = $80. So the initial total cost was $100 + $80 = $180.\nNext, we need to adjust this cost for the 50% price increase which means every item is now worth 50% more than what it was initially. To find out the current value, multiply the original cost by 1.5 (100% original cost plus 50% additional cost): \n$180 * 1.5 = $270\n\nNow let's calculate Sasha's potential sales revenue if she sells everything right away. The 10 boards would go for $10 per board so, $10 * 10 = $100. \nThe 5 boards would go for $16 per board so, $16 * 5 = $80. \nSo in total, if she sold everything immediately, she could potentially get $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nFinally, subtract the amount she paid for these items from the amount she could potentially earn by selling them. That gives us $180 - $270 = -$90. But since you can't have negative profits, we look into other factors such as market demand or competition among buyers. We cannot determine this without further information.\n\nThe hint provided didn't specify any details about the current price, instead it only mentions the percentage increase.
