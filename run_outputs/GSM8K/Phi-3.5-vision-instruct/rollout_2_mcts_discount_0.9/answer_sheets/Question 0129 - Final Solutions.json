If each visit takes 24 minutes, we convert this time into hours because the cost charged by the hospital is per hour. That is 24/60 = 0.4 hours per visit. Multiply this by 500 visits to get 500 x 0.4 = 200 hours spent seeing patients daily. Doctors earn $150 per hour so their total revenue from seeing patients daily is 150 x 200 = $30,000. The hospital charges $200 per hour so its total revenue is also 200 x 200 = $40,000. Subtract the expenses ($40,000) from the revenue ($30,000), and the loss becomes $10,000.
