Christina planned for 1/4 fewer guests than she invited. That means she plans for 3/4 of the invitees to attend. 3/4 of 16 is (3/4) * 16 = 12. Since .75 gift bags were needed per guest, we can calculate the actual number of guests by dividing the total number of gift bags by .75: Total gift bags / .75 = Number of guests. Substituting the known values, we get (16 * .75) / .75 = 16. Therefore, 12 guests showed up to the party.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the cost of the gift bags. Each bag costs $2 and there were 12 bags used, so the cost was 12 * $2 = $24."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we need to find out how many guests attend Christina's party. Since one fourth of the invitees don't show up, three quarters (3/4) of them do. So, if 16 friends were invited, then 16 * (3/4) = 12 showed up. Next, calculate how many bags needed: .75 bags per guest * 12 guests = 9 bags. Finally, multiply the number of bags needed by the cost of each bag: 9 bags * $2 per bag = $18. Therefore, Christina spends $18 on gift bags for her party.
