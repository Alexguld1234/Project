Firstly, we need to find out the total number of rabbits. The hint says it's 12 less than the sum of dogs and cats, so we first calculate the combined amount of dogs and cats.

Adding these together gets us 60 (for dogs) + 120 (for cats) = 180. Subtracting 12, since the rabbit count is 12 fewer than this, results in 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.
