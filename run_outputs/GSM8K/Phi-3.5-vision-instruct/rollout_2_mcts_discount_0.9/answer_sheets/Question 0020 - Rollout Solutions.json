First, we calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink: (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 or about 6.67 liters of water. Next, determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink: (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters. We combine both amounts of water before considering the spillage: 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. Since we spilled 1 liter during pouring, subtract this from our combined water volume: 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.
