We know that a 2% interest charge applies to each unit when buying them as an installment plan. So, the additional cost due to interest per unit would be 2/100 * $150 = $3. Therefore, the total cost of one cell phone including the interest would be $150 + $3 = $153. Since she bought five cell phones, the total cost before adding up the individual interest charges would be 5 * $153 = $765. As it is a 3-month period, this amount needs to be divided equally across the three months, which means each month, Shiela would pay a total of $765 / 3 = $255.

Firstly, let's find out the initial cost of all the cell phones before the interest is applied. That would be 5 units * $150/unit = $750.\nNow we need to calculate the interest for one month. It's calculated as 2% of $750 which equals $750 * 2 / 100 = $15.\nSo including the first month's interest, Shiela pays $750 + $15 = $765 per month.
