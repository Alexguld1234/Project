Out of 20 students, 20% or 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students. Of these remaining students, 25% or 4 students also enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, only 16 - 4 = 12 students remained for hip-hop dance. To find what percentage this represents out of the whole group, we divide 12 / 20 = 0.6, and convert it into a percentage by multiplying by 100. Hence, 0.6 * 100 = 60%.

Firstly, we need to find out how many students didn't enroll in contemporary or jazz dance. We know that there are 20 students and 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 20% of 20 = 4 students. Out of these 20 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance, so 5 students.\n\nSo far, this totals up to 4 (contemporary dance) + 5 (jazz dance) = 9 students who have not enrolled in hip-hop dance yet. This means there are 20 (total students) - 9 (students not in hip-hop) = 11 students who are enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, as per our instruction, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 11 (hip-hop dancers)/20 (total students) * 100% = 55%.\n\nFinal", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
