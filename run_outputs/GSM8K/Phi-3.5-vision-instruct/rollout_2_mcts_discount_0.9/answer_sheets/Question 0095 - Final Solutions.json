Firstly, we know that out of 200 students, 2/5 are boys which means 200 * (2/5) = 80 boys. This leaves us with 200 - 80 = 120 girls. Out of these 120 girls, 2/3 are part of Girl Scouts so 120 * (2/3) = 80 girls are Girl Scout members. To find the non-members among them, we subtract the scout members from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40. Therefore, there are 40 Grade 5 girls who are not part of the Girl Scouts.
