If a pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs $15 * 3 = $45. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, which means an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40. Now, let\u2019s calculate the total cost for everything Dillon bought. For the 4 watermelons, the cost is 4 * $45 = $180. For the 20 peppers, the cost is 20 * $15 = $300.
