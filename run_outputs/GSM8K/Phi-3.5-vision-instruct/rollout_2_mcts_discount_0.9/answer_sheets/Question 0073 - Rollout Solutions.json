We know that a 2% interest charge applies to each unit when buying them as an installment plan. So, the additional cost due to interest per unit would be 2/100 * $150 = $3. Therefore, the total cost of one cell phone including the interest would be $150 + $3 = $153. Since she bought five cell phones, the total cost before adding up the individual interest charges would be 5 * $153 = $765. As it is a 3-month period, this amount needs to be divided equally across the three months, which means each month, Shiela would pay a total of $765 / 3 = $255. The answer is: 255.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
