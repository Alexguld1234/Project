Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of all cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, we can multiply this amount by the total number of cookies (60) which gives us 60 * $0.10 = $6.00. This is the exact amount Carl needs to pay for the cookies. When he pays with a $10 bill, subtracting the $6.00 payment leaves him with $10 - $6.00 = $4.00 in change.
