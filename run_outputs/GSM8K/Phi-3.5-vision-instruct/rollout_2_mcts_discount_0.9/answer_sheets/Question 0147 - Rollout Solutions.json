Next six hours, 15 bees (half) return.\n3. Following six hours, another 60 bees leave since it's double the original amount.\n4. All remaining bees in the first two sets (that didn\u2019t return) decide to leave in the last set. Since we know only 15 bees returned during the second six hours, all others went back out. We need to calculate if any of them decided to stay or not.\n\nNow, let's find out what happens in the last hour. Let's add up the numbers: \n- Beads initially left: 30\n- Bean return in second half: 15\n- Additional beans leave after the second half: 60\n\nTotal bees involved until the last 6 hours = 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees.\n\nSince only 15 bees returned during the second half, the rest had to re-exit which means:\n105 total bees - 15 bees that returned = 90 bees needed to replace the ones who re-exited.\n\nSince no information about additional bees returning after the third set of 6 hours is provided, we can assume that none exited without returning.

First, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the next 6 hours, half of those (which is 15) return. This means she sees 2 times 30 minus the ones who came back, so it is 60 - 15 which equals 45 bees leaving again. These bees didn't return yet, so all of them leave in the next 6 hours, meaning no additional bees return since none have returned yet during this time frame. Thus, we conclude there are 45 fewer bees than when she started counting because these weren't accounted for earlier due to their eventual departure without returning, making 30 - 15 = 15 bees remaining. However, if considering only the count of bees actively leaving in the subsequent cycle, it would result in 45 - 15 = 30 bees leaving; therefore, 15 bees return but still result in net loss of 30 - 15 = 15 bees overall.

In the next six hours, half of the bees that initially left, or 15 bees, return to the hive. Since twice as many bees as the original number that left flew away in the following hour, we know 2 * 30 = 60 bees flew out in the third set of six hours. However, since not all of those had flown away, we subtract the 15 that returned, resulting in 60 - 15 = 45 bees leaving. Therefore, 15 bees return, but ultimately, there is a net loss of 30 - 15 = 15 bees over the eight-hour period. The answer is: 15.", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
