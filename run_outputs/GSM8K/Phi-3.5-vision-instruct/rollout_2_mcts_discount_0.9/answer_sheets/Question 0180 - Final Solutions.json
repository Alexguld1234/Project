Firstly, we determine what fraction of votes the winner received, which according to the hint was 3/4 or 75%. That means the winner got 75% of the votes while the loser got the remaining 25%. To find out how many votes the loser got, first, we need to find the value of one vote. We know the total number of students was 80. Therefore, (1/80) represents one vote. Since the loser received 25% of the votes, this translates into 25% of 80 students which equals (25/100)*80 = 20 students.
