The five 4x4x10 boards cost 5 * $16 = $80. Combined, these cost $100 + $80 = $180.\n\nNow let's find out the increased cost: With the 50% price increase, the ten 2x4x10 boards now cost $10 + $5 = $15 each. And the five 4x4x10 boards still cost $16 each. The new combined cost is (10 * $15) + (5 * $16) = $150 + $80 = $230.\n\nTo determine her profit, we need to subtract the initial total cost from the new total cost: $230 - $180 = $50. The hint provided doesn't affect the calculation since we are only asked for the profits made when selling the existing inventory at its current value. Therefore, regardless of the future price changes or other potential expenses like transportation or advertising costs, Sasha makes a profit of $50 upon selling her entire inventory of lumber.
