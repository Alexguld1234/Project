First, we know that 16 eggs were laid by the ducks. Janet eats 3 for breakfast, leaving us with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining. Since one egg is used up for each muffin, and she makes 4 muffins, another 4 eggs are used up, leaving us with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs. These 9 eggs are sold at the market for $2 each. Therefore, 9 * $2 equals $18 made every day at the market.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
