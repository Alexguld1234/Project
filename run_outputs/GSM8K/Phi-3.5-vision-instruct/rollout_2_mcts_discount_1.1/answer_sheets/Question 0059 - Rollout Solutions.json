Each cluster has 20 fruit, so all the clusters together make 6 * 20 = 120 fruits. To find out the total number of fruits on the bush, we need to include those scattered individually. So it would be 120 (from clusters) + 67 (individual). Adding these up gives us 120 + 67 which equals 187. The hint confirms our calculation as well.
