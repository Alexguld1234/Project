On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To calculate this, multiply the Tuesday depth by two-thirds or \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).

On Monday, the tank was 17 feet deep. On Tuesday, it increased by 7 feet, so it became 17 + 7 = 24 feet deep. On Wednesday, the depth becomes two thirds of the previous day, which means \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) times 24 feet. This calculation results in \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 24 = 16 \\) feet.
