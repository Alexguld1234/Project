Firstly, we know Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston, which means Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. To find out how many sheep all three have together, add their amounts: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep in total.
