First, we need to find out how far Julia rowed before reaching shore. Since it takes her 64 seconds and she rows 10 feet per 16 seconds (as mentioned), let's calculate the distance covered: 64 / 16 = 4 times 10 feet. That means Julia rowed 40 feet.\nNext, since the boat leaks at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed, we can determine how much water leaked during those 40 feet: 40/10 * 2 liters = 8 liters.

For simplicity, let's assume the average speed of Julia's rowing is around 2 feet/second so it equals 2 ft/s / 10 ft/minute = 0.2 ft/s or about 0.2 inches/sec.

We first need to figure out how fast Julia is moving toward the shore before considering the leak. We know that it took her 64 seconds to cover the remaining distance, meaning she traveled at a rate of 2 feet per second.
