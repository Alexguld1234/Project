This would be 7 lemons times $1.5 per lemon, equaling $10.50. From here, subtract the yearly costs of watering and feeding the tree, which amounts to $3. Thus, the net profit every year equals $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. Next, divide the original cost of planting the tree, which was $90, by the net profit of $7.50 per year to find out how long it takes until the tree pays for itself. Doing so yields 90 / 7.50, which equals approximately 12.1111 years. Since one cannot have a fraction of a year when counting full years of profitability, we round up to 13 whole years needed for the tree to pay off its initial cost.

Carlos needs to wait until the net profit exceeds the initial investment of $90. Each year, he makes a net profit of $8.5 (revenue from lemons sold minus costs).
