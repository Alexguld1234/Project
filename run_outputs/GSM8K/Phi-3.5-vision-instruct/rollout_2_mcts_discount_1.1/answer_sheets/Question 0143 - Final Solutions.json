First, we identify the cost of each item without tax as mentioned above (milk: $2, eggs: $3, light bulbs: $3, cups: $3, roach traps: $4). We sum these up to get the subtotal which is 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = $15. Next, since only four out of five items are not food, we apply the 10% tax rate to those. To find the tax amount on the nonfood items ($2 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $12), multiply it by 10/100 or 0.10, yielding a tax of 0.10 * 12 = $1.20. Finally, add this tax to our original subtotal of $15.

We know the pre-tax prices of the items: milk (2 dollars), eggs (3 dollars), light bulbs (3 dollars), cups (3 dollars), and roach traps (4 dollars). Adding them together gives us a subtotal of 15 dollars. Now we need to calculate the tax on this amount. Since it's 10%, multiply 15 dollars by 10%. To find 10% of any number, you divide it by 10. Therefore, 15 / 10 equals 1.5. The tax is $1.50. Add this tax to the initial 15 dollars to get the total cost. 15 + 1.5 equals 16.5.
