First, we find out what 10% of the monthly charge ($140) would be: 10/100 * 140 = $14 discount per month. Subtracting this from the original monthly charge, we get: 140 - 14 = $126 for the second half of the year (6 months).\nNow let's add up both amounts: 840 + (126 * 6), which equals $840 + $756 = $1596.
