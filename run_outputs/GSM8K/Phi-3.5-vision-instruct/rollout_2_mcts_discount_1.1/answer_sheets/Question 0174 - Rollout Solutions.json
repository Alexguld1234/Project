To convert 5 seconds into minutes, divide by 60: 5 / 60 = 1/12 minutes. Total time per potato then becomes 1.5 + 1/12 = 1.583... or approximately 1.58 minutes.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find out how long it will take him to prep all of them. To do this, multiply 95 seconds by 60 potatoes which equals 5700 seconds.
