Firstly, we need to convert miles into feet. Steve is 15840 feet from the school and Tim is 10560 feet from the school. Next, calculate time it takes for each student to reach home. Steve rides his bike at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes. Tim rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10560 / 264 = approximately 40 minutes. Since Steve arrives earlier, the winner (Steve) needs to wait for Tim to finish. We subtract the times to find out the difference: 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.
