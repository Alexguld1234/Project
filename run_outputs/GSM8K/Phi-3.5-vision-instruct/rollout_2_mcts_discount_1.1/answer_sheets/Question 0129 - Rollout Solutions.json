There are 500 patients who spend 24 minutes with the doctor. That equals 500 * 24 / 60 = 200 hours worth of work for the doctors. These 200 hours cost the doctors 200 * 150 = 30000 dollars.

Firstly, let's find out how many hours patients spend consulting with a doctor. If one patient spends 24 minutes consulting with a doctor, which equates to 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
