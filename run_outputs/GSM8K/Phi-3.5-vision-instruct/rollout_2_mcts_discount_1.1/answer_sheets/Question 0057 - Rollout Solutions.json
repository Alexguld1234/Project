First, let's find out the remaining space on the truck for additional weight. We take the weight limit and subtract the current load. That means the truck can hold up to 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds worth of boxes. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the available weight by the weight per box. Thus, the calculation is 1245 / 15 = 83. The answer is: 83.", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
