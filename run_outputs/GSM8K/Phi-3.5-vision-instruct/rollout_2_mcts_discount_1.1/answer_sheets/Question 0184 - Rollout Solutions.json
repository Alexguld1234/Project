[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). Out of 6 possible outcomes, only one outcome is favorable for rolling a number greater than 3. Thus, the probability is 1/6 or approximately 16.67%.", "2": "Calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers on a six-sided die. For each round, the chance of rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6) is 3 out of 6 (or 1 out of 2), so the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25% for both rounds combined. To get two consecutive even numbers, we multiply this result by itself because these events are independent. So, the combined probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 or about 6.25%.", "3": "Find the difference between the probabilities. This can be expressed as 16.67% - 6.25% = 10.42%.", "4": "The answer is approximately 10.42%, but since you asked for a numeric response, rounded to the nearest whole number would make sense.
