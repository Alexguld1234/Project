Firstly, Adrien currently makes $28571.43 annually since that amount represents a 40% raise from when he made $40000.\nNow consider Lylah who initially had 30% less than Adrien\u2019s annual income. If we set up the ratio (Lylah\u2019s initial) : (Adrien\u2019s initial), we get 1.3L : L which simplifies into 1.3:1 or 1.3. This means that every dollar that Adrien earns, Lylah earns 1.3 times less. Thus Lylah\u2019s current salary could be calculated as L * 1.3, where L is her original salary.\nTo find out how much Lylah\u2019s salary needs to increase to equal Adrien's current one, we simply subtract Lylah's current salary from Adrien's.\nThus: $28571.43 \u2013 Lylah\u2019s Annual Salary = Amount Lylah Needs To Earn Additional Per Year.\nSubstituting Lylah's current salary ($28571.43/1.3) as per above calculation yields: $28571.43 \u2013 $22051.52 approx. = $6519.91.\nThis means that Lylah's salary required to be increased by approximately $6519.91 to be equal to Adrien's current yearly salary of $28571.43.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.

First, let's find out how much Lylah's salary was initially before any increases.\n\nStep 1: Determine Lylah's initial salary using adrien's initial and final salaries.\nWe know that Adrien's current salary ($40000 / 1.4) or approximately $28571.43 (rounded up), represents a 40% increase from 4 years ago when it was $40000. This means that one year ago, Adrien made 100% of his salary since the current amount includes the 40% increase. Let's denote last year's salary as Y. Thus, Y = Adrien's Initial Salary which equals to $40000. Therefore, the current salary is represented as Y * 1.4. So we have $28571.43 approx. = $40000 * 1.4, therefore Adrien's Original Salary = $28571.43 / 1.4 = $20387.45 approx.\n\nStep 2: Determine the percentage increase required for Lylah\u2019s salary to equal Adrien's salary.\nSince Adrien's salary began at $20387.45 and ended at approximately $28571.43, thus the increase equates to $28571.43 - $20387.45 = $8183.98.

Their individual raises come up as follows: Adrien's new salary is already calculated to be $56000; Lylah's new salary would be $30769.23 * 1.30 = $39996.48.
