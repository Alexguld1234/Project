Firstly, since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, when Sarah does 400 pounds, Raymond would do 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. Secondly, because Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. To find out the difference between what Raymond and David do, we subtract their amounts: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds. The answer is: 100.", "value": 0.96875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
