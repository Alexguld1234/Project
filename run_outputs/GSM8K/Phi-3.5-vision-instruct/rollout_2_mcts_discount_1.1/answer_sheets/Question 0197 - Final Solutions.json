Firstly we know the total population of the city of Soda is 23786. We also know that it includes 8417 men. Therefore, the sum of women and children equals the remaining population after accounting for men. To find out the number of women, we subtract the number of men from the total population: 23786 - 8417 = 15369. Next, since we know the exact count of women already, we need to calculate the difference between these numbers: 15369 (women and children combined) - 9092 (women) = 6277.

First, we need to calculate the total population excluding men, as it includes both women and children. Initially, there were 23786 inhabitants in Soda. By subtracting the number of men (8417), we get the combined count of women and children: 23786 - 8417 = 15369. Thus, this number represents the sum of all women and children in the city. Since no other specific information about the gender breakdown among these 15369 individuals is provided, we conclude that this figure already accounts for all children together along with the women.
