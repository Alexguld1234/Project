She sells a third at the green house, so she has 2/3C remaining. She sells 2 more to the red house, leaving 2/3C - 2. At the orange house, she sells half of the remaining amount, leaving (2/3C - 2)/2. She ends up with 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (2/3C - 2)/2 = 5. Multiplying both sides by 2 and expanding, we have 4C - 4 = 10, leading to 4C = 14, thus C = 3.5. However, since one can't sell half a vacuum cleaner, this seems incorrect. Let's try again: Melanie has C vacuum cleaners initially. She sells C/3 at the green house and then C/2 - 2 at the red house. At the orange house, she sells (C/3)/2. She ends up with C - C/3 - C/2 + 4 = 5. Combining like terms and clearing fractions, we get 10C/6 = 5, hence 5C/6 = 5, which means C = 6. Since it's not possible to sell half a vacuum cleaner, let\u2019s check if rounding down makes sense: Initially, Melanie had C vacuum cleaners. After selling a third, 2/3C remains. Selling another two reduces this to 2/3C - 2. Half of what's left then becomes (2/3C - 2)/2, which is 5 - 5/6 = 5/6 * 5 = 5/6 * 6/2 = 5/4. Rounding down, as we need whole numbers for actual sales, and ensuring no fractional vacuum cleaners remain implies a solution around 6.
