Since his salary is now 40% greater than it was four years ago, we can write this as Adrien's Salary * 1.4 = $40000.

Firstly, Adrien currently makes $28571.43 annually since that amount represents a 40% raise from when he made $40000.\nNow consider Lylah who initially had 30% less than Adrien\u2019s annual income. If we set up the ratio (Lylah\u2019s initial) : (Adrien\u2019s initial), we get 1.3L : L which simplifies into 1.3:1 or 1.3. This means that every dollar that Adrien earns, Lylah earns 1.3 times less. Thus Lylah\u2019s current salary could be calculated as L * 1.3, where L is her original salary.\nTo find out how much Lylah\u2019s salary needs to increase to equal Adrien's current one, we simply subtract Lylah's current salary from Adrien's.\nThus: $28571.43 \u2013 Lylah\u2019s Annual Salary = Amount Lylah Needs To Earn Additional Per Year.\nSubstituting Lylah's current salary ($28571.43/1.3) as per above calculation yields: $28571.43 \u2013 $22051.52 approx. = $6519.91.\nThis means that Lylah's salary required to be increased by approximately $6519.91 to be equal to Adrien's current yearly salary of $28571.43.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.
