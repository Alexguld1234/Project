They took back 1/3 of this amount on Saturday which means taking back 6 flamingos (because 18 divided by 3 equals 6). These six flamingos were painted white. On Sunday, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making the total 36 again. However, since the six white ones remained unchanged, there would still only be six white flamingos. Therefore, the difference between pink and white flamingos would remain the same as before: 36 pink minus 6 white equals 30 extra pink flamingos compared to white.
