        " 'x' cars went through (this we need to find out). Another 20 cars go through during the second half of the jam but since it takes place over another hour than before, these additional vehicles still make sense within our initial frame. However, if those 5 decide not to continue driving because one driver exits their car alone; this reduces the count coming into consideration as only those who continued would contribute towards solving the original problem. Here, you know all details except 'x'. Thus your best bet here could involve calculating what remains using the provided figures considering continuity/total duration instead of instant time units such as changing every measure back & forth i.e., making sure whether hours or mins stay consistent throughout calculations etc... But wait! Do notice something tricky right underneath my explanation about consistency while interpreting data across varying timelines \u2013 well yes indeed I totally agree!! It actually sounds redundant stating explicitly though isn\u2019t just plain obvious\u2026 No harm no foul however seems superfluous unnecessarily complexifying situation further when simpler direct approach yields same result without extra mental overhead involved thanks mainly due lack awareness myself initially missed catching onto simplification logic itself despite effort put trying unearth missing clue thereby getting stuck longer way round rather taking easier route directly leading quickly eventually arriving correctly nonetheless wasn't too bad mistake made obviously having good grasp concepts needed anyhow otherwise couldn\u2019t possibly figure anything wrong even knowing basics thoroughly none beyond mentioned yet..

That leads us to equation: Original Number Of Car \u2013 Exiting Numbers of car equal passing numbers plus not passing numbers. We can translate this into mathematic form: 30\u2212(number_of_exits)=((Number_Of_cars_passing)+NotPassing).
