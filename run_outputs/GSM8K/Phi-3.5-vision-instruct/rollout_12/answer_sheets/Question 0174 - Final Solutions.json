Firstly, we know that it takes Billy 30 seconds to peel every potato. This doesn't change regardless of whether or not he also cuts them beforehand. Since the problem states that he spends the same amount of time (about 30 seconds) to peel each potato without regard to cutting, our calculation remains simple because both tasks \u2014 peeling and cutting \u2014 contribute equally to the overall time spent on each individual potato.\n\nSo even though cutting each potato adds another 5 seconds onto the initial 30 seconds of peeling, since these times are 'roughly equal,' as mentioned in the question, we can assume that the total additional time required just for cutting each potato would still result in the same average time spent per potato which is stated to be 30 seconds. Therefore, Billy spends 30 seconds to peel each potato plus 5 seconds to cut it out, equalling exactly 35 seconds per potato when considering cutting too.
