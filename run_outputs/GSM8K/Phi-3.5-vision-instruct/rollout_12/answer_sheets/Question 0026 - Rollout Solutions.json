To find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then add them together. First, let's find out how much was spent on shorts: Since shorts cost $16.50 each and Mishka bought 3 pairs, that would be 3 times $16.50 which equals $49.50. Next, we calculate the cost for pants: Pants cost $22.50 each, so for 3 pairs, that would be 3 times $22.50, equaling $67.50. Lastly, since we know the cost for shoes (which amounts to $42), but not the exact count as for pants, we can assume she bought exactly 3 pairs too or use another provided unit value if different. Assuming she bought 3 pairs just like pants, then 3 pairs of shoes would also come to 3 times $42, equalling $126. Therefore, combining all these calculations, we get $49.50 for shorts plus $67.50 for pants plus $126 for shoes, resulting in a grand total spending of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.
