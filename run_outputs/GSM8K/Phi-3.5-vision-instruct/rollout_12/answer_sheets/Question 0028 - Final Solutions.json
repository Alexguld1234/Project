Firstly, we need to figure out how long it took him to get up to the point of his first stop. Since his first stop happened after 20 miles, that's halfway through his journey, because 60 divided by 2 is 30.\n\nSecondly, we know that he made another stop exactly 15 miles away from the finish line which means he went back 15 miles from the start towards home. Hence, he had covered 20 miles to reach his first stop and then another 20 miles back reaching the point right under the 15 mile mark from his starting place but still above the ending point. Therefore, the length of the stretch of road he traveled between these two points can be found using simple subtraction: 20 miles (for the first leg of the ride) minus 15 miles (the second leg), resulting in a difference of 5 miles.\n\nHowever, keep in mind, this calculation doesn't consider the fact that Henry may not necessarily have traveled all the way back to zero again once he passed the point just below his second stop. We don\u2019t actually need to concern ourselves with calculating this part since the question only asks us about the distance he traveled specifically between his first and second stops, rather than the entire distance he covered over the course of his entire journey\u2014which would include any additional distance he might have covered beyond what we\u2019re asked to calculate here.
