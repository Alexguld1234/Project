First, we need to find out how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. Since it was 2/5 times more than Monday, which was 5 articles, we calculate 2/5 * 5 = 2 articles extra on Tuesday. Therefore, she wrote 5 (from Monday) + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Next, we need to figure out the number of articles on Wednesday, which was twice the number from Tuesday, so 7 * 2 = 14 articles. To find out the total time spent writing, we multiply the number of articles written each day by the time taken per article, which is 4 hours. Monday: 5 articles * 4 hours = 20 hours; Tuesday: 7 articles * 4 hours = 28 hours; Wednesday: 14 articles * 4 hours = 56 hours. Finally, we add up all the hours together: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.
