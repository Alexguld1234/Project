We know that the total number of wins plus losses equals the total number of games played, which is 22. So, if we let W represent the number of wins and L represent the number of losses, we can write this as W + L = 22. Additionally, it's given that the team won 8 more games than they lost. Therefore, we can also write this relationship as W = L + 8. Now we substitute W in the first equation with L + 8: (L + 8) + L = 22. Combining like terms, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 2L = 14. Finally, dividing both sides by 2 results in L = 7. Knowing the value of L, we can find W using the second relation again: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.
