Calculate how many miles she can travel until the tank is full: Since she has already driven 100 miles without refueling and only needs 4 more gallons to make it to a full tank, she can travel another 100 miles before needing to add gas. This means the tank holds enough space for 100 additional miles plus whatever was initially filled when she started driving.

Calculate the total potential distance on a full tank: If Sophia's car has a total capacity of 12 gallons, and 4 gallons brings it back to being full, then she can theoretically travel 4 times what she can cover in those four gallons while not having refueled.
