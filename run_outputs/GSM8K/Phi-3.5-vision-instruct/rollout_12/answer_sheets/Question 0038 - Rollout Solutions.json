Therefore, if he runs 60 miles divided by 3 days, this results in 60 / 3 = 20 miles in total for these three days. Since one third of his total weekly mileage happens during these days, and he only runs part-time for the latter two days, we can conclude that for both remaining days combined, he runs double what he would for all three days individually, meaning 2 * 20 miles = 40 miles. This results in a total of 20 miles + 40 miles = 60 miles for the entire week, thus maintaining his consistent weekly mileage.

Hence dividing the total distance covered into the whole week yields us another expression: 60 miles / 60 hours = d\n\nNow let's set both expressions equal to one another since they represent distance covered but differ only by unit (miles vs. kilometers), thus yielding us: 6 hours * d miles/hour = 60 miles; solving for 'd', we get d = 10 miles/hour.\n\nSo, John runs 10 miles per hour.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
