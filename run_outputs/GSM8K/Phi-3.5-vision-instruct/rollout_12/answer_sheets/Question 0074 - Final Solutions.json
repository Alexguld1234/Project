Firstly, we know that the price for one pot of Marigold is exactly $2.74, which cannot be sold due to condition 4 (no change). Therefore, no revenue can come from Marigolds. Secondly, although the price per pot of Petunia seems less than its original price because it was rounded down, only whole numbers can be used according to this specific situation. Thus, despite the actual price being $1.87 per petunia, when considering the constraints imposed in conditions 1 through 4, we assume prices become $2 each, implying that all 9 petunias sold equal $18.
