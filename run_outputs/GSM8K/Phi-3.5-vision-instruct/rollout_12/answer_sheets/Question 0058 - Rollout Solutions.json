This includes both the actual cost of the groceries and additional fees like the delivery fee. Since we know the delivery fee is $3.00 but not the other fees included in the original $40, let's first subtract the delivery fee to find out the cost without it. That means the adjusted price (before the tip) is actually less than $40 because you would need to add back the $3 delivery fee plus whatever else might be included in the remaining $37.\n\nNow let's account for the tip. We know Stephen added a $4.00 tip, which means he paid more overall due to these fees ($40). If we subtract the $4 tip from the final amount, we get $36. This suggests that the cost of just the groceries themselves\u2014without any fees except for the delivery\u2014would likely come to around that amount or slightly below since fees can vary widely depending on location and provider, even without considering the tip itself.\n\nFinally, since we cannot determine exactly how much of the remaining $36 represents 'just groceries,' we don't know precisely what portion of it goes toward fees excluding the tip. However, based on common practices and general knowledge about such services, one could reasonably estimate the base food item costs to be roughly 80% to 90% of the total before including any hidden charges; thus, perhaps something like $32.80 to $35.20 before fees. This, however, remains speculative until confirmed information is available.
