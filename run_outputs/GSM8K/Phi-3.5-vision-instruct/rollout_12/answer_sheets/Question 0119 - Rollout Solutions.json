First, we need to find out how much Adrien earned last year compared to four years ago. His salary last year was 30% higher than four years ago, so it was 1.3 times greater (since 30% as a decimal is .3). Therefore, if he made $40000 four years ago, his salary last year would be $40000 * 1.3 = $52000.\n\nFour years later, Adrien's salary grew another 40%. That means his current salary is 1.4 times larger than last year's (since 40% can also be expressed as 0.4 or 1/0.2). Thus, his present salary is $52000 * 1.4 = $72800.\n\nNow let's assume that Lylah's salary increased in the same proportion as Adrien's throughout these four years. Since the increase in percentage was the same across all years for both individuals, we could say that the total salaries they received four years later share the same ratio as their initial salaries because of similar proportional growth rates. \n\nHence, the sum of their salaries four years later should remain the same as initially since the proportions remained constant over time due to steady annual increases. This principle holds true regardless of any individual fluctuations during those years. So the combined amount should stay identical to when we first calculated it. \n\nInitially, Let's add up Adrien's original salary and Lylah's unspecified initial salary s to get S. \n\nSo, S = $40000 (Adrien) + L (Lylah's unknown initial salary).\n\nAfter four years, their new salaries become 1.4 * ($40000) for Adrien and (1.4 * L) for Lylah, respectively.
