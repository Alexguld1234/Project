Finally, she sold half of what was left to the orange house, so we can set up the equation as follows: ((2/3)x - 2) / 2 = 5 (the remaining vacuum cleaners). We need to solve this equation for x. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2/3x - 2 = 10. Adding 2 to both sides gives us 2/3x = 12. To find x, multiply both sides by 3/2, resulting in x = 12 * 3/2. Simplifying this gives x = 18.
