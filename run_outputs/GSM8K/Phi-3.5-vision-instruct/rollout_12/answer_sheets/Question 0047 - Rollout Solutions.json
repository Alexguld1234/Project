Therefore, John bought 5 blue ties at $40 each, which totals to $200.\n\nNow let's calculate the cost of red ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means they cost 150% (or 1.5 times) the price of blue ties.

Therefore, since red ties are priced 50% higher than blue ties ($40), the cost of one red tie is $60. Given that he bought 10 red ties, he must have spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties alone.
