This means the calculation isn't perfect yet.\n\nIn fact, considering we initially found 40 as the total (including both the ones that drove through entirely and others that could have left via exits within the first 15 minutes), we need to verify against actual data rather than solely rely on calculated numbers based purely on given figures without assumptions. \n\nGiven just the information provided though\u2014assuming no additional details are needed regarding the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam during the whole period versus merely the portion after their first encounter with it\u2014we follow the logic that 20 cars drove through in the latter half because one half plus one third equals two fifths overall, hence two fifths times three represents sixteen over ten, translating into eighteen over twenty which equates back again down to twelve parts out of the original thirty minus any that departed early enough to be counted twice when adding it to our 20 figure resulting once more in four extra from our previous count.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 5}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Cars have lined up on the motorway.
