From this information, it's clear that Jackson cannot be 4 or any other age since he needs to be one year older than Amy and 4 years younger than Corey (givenamy was 5 years older than Jackson). Therefore, the only possibility based on our clues is that Amy must be 5 years older than Jackson but also 2 years younger than Corey (who is already established as being 11), making Amy 9 years old. This means Jackson would need to be 9 - 5 = 4 years old. However, Jackson can't be 4 according to hint suggesting Jackson could not be 4, meaning there might be a mistake with our calculation or provided hints. Let's reevaluate the information provided. If Jackson is 4 years old (as suggested by our first calculation) and Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Amy would be 9 years old. But then James would be 10 years old, leaving no difference between his and Corey's ages if James is supposed to be 1 year younger than Corey. This discrepancy indicates either our assumption about Jackson\u2019s age is incorrect or there's an error with the initial conditions provided. Given these inconsistencies, let's try another approach using the information that James is 10, one year younger than Corey. Since James is 10, Corey is indeed 11 (one year older than James), fulfilling the condition.
