She used 220 for her job, which would leave her short. However, this contradicts the information provided, as she also received additional Post-it notes in the package. To resolve this, let's assume that even though she appears to run out of Post-it notes based on what was initially available (80), because she purchased more, she still has enough for both jobs and ends up with 23 post-it notes in total. First, let\u2019s find out how many she actually has in the end considering her initial supply and additional purchase.\n\n1. Start with the initial amount of 80 post-it notes.\n2. Add the amount she likely purchased during her shopping trip since the hint suggests extra purchases beyond what she could have reasonably exhausted without running out completely.\n3. Subtract the amount used for the coffee shop orders.\n4. The result should match the 23 post-it notes mentioned later in the prompt if all went according to plan with her extra purchases.\n\nGiven these steps, here's the breakdown:\n\na. Initial 80 + Bought more = Total before use\nb. Total minus 220 used = Remaining\nc. Remaining should equal 23 (as per the question statement)\n\nHowever, to clarify further, typically such problems don\u2019t involve negative numbers when counting items unless explicitly stated otherwise or involved in a subtraction context. Negative numbers can't represent physical objects like Post-it notes, hence, their absence in the previous calculation was probably due to incorrect interpretation.
