Firstly, let\u2019s calculate the number of boys based on the amount of girls: 60 girls mean there are twice as many boys which equals 120 boys.

And finally, the third class has just half as many students compared to those first ones due to the fact that this class doesn\u2019t yet fill up its whole capacity; hence 8/2 equals 4, not 5. Therefore, combining everything together results in 20 (first class) plus another 20 (second class), making it 40. Then, including the girl from the third class, which makes a total sum of 41 students. Dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher yields us the number of teachers needed, which comes out to be 41 / 5 or 8 remainder 1.

With the next hint, let's find out the total number of students including both boys and girls. From what we calculated earlier, we know that the total number of students (boys plus girls) is 120 (boys) + 60 (girls), equaling 180 students. Next, considering each classroom contains 5 students and there are 5 teachers divided among them (as suggested by the hint), you need to divide the total number of students by 5 (since 5 students per teacher). This tells us that 180 / 5 equals 36. But remember, these numbers represent groups of classrooms rather than actual teachers, so we actually round down to get 36, because having part of a classroom wouldn\u2019t make sense.
