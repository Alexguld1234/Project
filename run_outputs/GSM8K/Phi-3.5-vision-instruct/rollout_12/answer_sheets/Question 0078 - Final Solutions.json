Clearly, purchasing smaller groups of 2 offers a better rate per ball. To find out if Vincent spends more when buying 18 in smaller groups, we first see what he could get for $16 because $16 is twice as much as 12 (the closest multiple of 3 below 18), which is 6 packets of 3 (totaling 18 balls) for $2.50 * 6 = $15.
