Since each round trip is double the length of one way (because he goes to another side), that means each round trip equals 100 yards per side multiplied by 2. That results in 200 yards for one round trip. To find out the total distance for Blake, multiply the number of rounds by the distance per round trip: 15 rounds * 200 yards/round trip = 3000 yards.\n\nFor Kelly:\nShe runs all around the 40-yard line 34 times. Since running along the 40-yard line covers twice the length as going straight up or down because you travel twice the horizontal distance when you go around the 40-yard line instead of crossing directly over the center. Each time rounding, she covers a distance equivalent to 40 yards times 2, which totals 80 yards. The total distance for Kelly would thus be 34 rounds * 80 yards/round = 2720 yards.\n\nNow let\u2019s calculate their differences:\n\nTo determine who ran farther, we subtract the winner\u2019s total distance from the loser\u2019s total distance.
