First, calculate the distance John covers in the first day: 3 hours * 60 miles/hour = 180 miles. This seems incorrect because we know he runs 60 miles total a week and cannot cover 180 miles just in the first day. Let's recalculate carefully: John runs 60 miles in total but only 3 of them come from the first day since he runs for 3 hours and doesn't exceed 60 miles even when multiplied by his speed. For the second and third day, let's assume he still runs for 1.5 hours and gets 45 miles out of both days. So adding them together, we see that John indeed runs 60 miles total, which confirms our original approach was correct; however, the way you calculated his average speed didn\u2019t consider the total mileage for the whole week yet. To find his average speed, divide the total weekly distance by the sum of daily speeds. Given that he runs 60 miles a week across four days: Total Speed = 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles/day. Since the problem states he runs 3 hours the first day, we can determine what his average speed is by dividing his total weekly distance (60 miles) by the sum of his daily speeds. However, without knowing exactly how many hours he runs on the following days\u2014which we suspect based on the hint may have been a misprint and thus is a matter of interpretation\u2014we can't confirm any numerical values beyond what has already been computed above regarding the total distance he ran during the entire week.

He also mentioned running 3 hours on the first day but at a different pace than the following two days (half as much time). Since we cannot determine exactly what his pace was during those last two days without additional data, let us assume it remained consistent throughout the week, implying 20 miles per day like the rest of the week. Therefore, he would still cover 20 miles each day over the course of the remaining two days since the question doesn't specify any change in pace.
