Since they both got 1/6th each, we add their shares together (1/6 + 1/6), which equals 1/3rd of the original amount. So the first two girls combined got (1/3) * 24 liters = 8 liters. Subtracting the water taken by these two girls from the initial amount leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 liters. Now, subtract the 6 liters that the third person took from the remaining amount. This leaves us with 16 - 6 = 10 liters.
