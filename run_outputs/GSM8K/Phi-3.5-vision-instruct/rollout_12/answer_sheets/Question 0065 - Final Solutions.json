First, we need to find out how long Jim is up during one cycle which includes both watching TV and reading.

Firstly, let's find out how long he spends watching TV per cycle: 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour sleeping makes it a cycle lasting 3 hours.

Over four weeks, Jim would engage in 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours of activities combining both watching TV and rest.

First, we find out how long Jim sleeps when he watches TV for 2 hours. Since it's half the time, he sleeps 2/2 = 1 hour.

Multiplying this by four weeks gives us 9 hours x 4 weeks = 36 hours. However, since only 2 hours are spent watching TV and not reading, which was requested, let's consider only the TV time; thus the correct calculation would exclude any additional reading.
