We start with 80 Post-it notes (Condition 1). After using them for 220 cups of coffee (Condition 3), she would need 220 Post-it notes if all cup sizes used only one.

Therefore, to find out how many notes were actually needed for those 220 cups, subtract the 23 remaining notes from the original amount: 80 - 23 = 57.
