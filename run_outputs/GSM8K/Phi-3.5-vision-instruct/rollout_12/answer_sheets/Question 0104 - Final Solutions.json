Firstly, we find out what a quarter of the puzzle looks like. We know that one quarter is equal to 1/4, so if we apply this to the 1000 piece puzzle it becomes 1/4 * 1000 which equals to 250 pieces that Poppy already put together.\nSo we subtract those from our starting point; 1000 - 250 leaves us with 750 pieces still unplaced when Poppy finishes. Next, we need to consider how many of these remaining pieces her mom adds, which amounts to a third or 1/3 of whatever remains after Poppy's placement. Thus, calculating 1/3 * 750, you get 250 pieces. Hence, the remaining pieces are again reduced once her mom adds her contribution.

First, Poppy places 1/4 of the 1000 pieces which equals 250 pieces (since 1000 divided by 4 equals 250).

That leaves us with 750 pieces not yet on the table (1000 minus 250), representing half of what is left when you remove a quarter of it.
