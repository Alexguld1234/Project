She does one full lap (back and forth) which is 200 yards just like Blake but only completes it 1 time, yielding 200 yards as well. Afterward, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each trip to the 40-yard line would cover 40/2= 20 yards per trip. With 2 trips involved in every trip around the field, it totals out to 2*20= 40 yards per round. This means that each 'round' is equivalent to half of what the other person is doing. Therefore, Kelly effectively covers 40 yards twice (for both going towards and coming away from the 40-yard mark). That comes out to 40*2 = 80 yards per round or 34 rounds * 80 yards = 2720 yards.\n\nNow compare their distances: Blake ran 3000 yards while Kelly ran 2720 yards.
