First, calculate the time it took for Tom to sail from 1 to 4 PM at 10 mph. Since no specific distance or direction is given, we will assume he sails straight from point A (his starting location) to B (the destination). We will represent this distance as D. Time taken from 1 to 4 PM would be 3 hours because the problem states that Tom sails until 4 PM without any break in between.\nDuring these three hours, Tom covers a distance of 10 * 3 = 30 units (here 'units' could mean miles but isn't specified clearly in your prompt; assuming 'units' stands for miles based on common usage and context provided throughout all similar problems). Therefore, D = 30. Now, since it takes less than half an hour for the return journey (from 4 to 5), which totals approximately 0.5 hours, if Tom returns at 10 mph speed, the remaining distance should also equal 10 * 0.5 = 5 units. However, considering we're working within a single unit system (which we assumed to be miles), the calculated distances seem inconsistent due to different speed rates applied over presumably the same physical space. This inconsistency implies either additional parameters missing (such as whether segments of the journey involve different terrain types, or maybe wind factors affecting speed variability), or perhaps misinterpretation of what was meant by \"straight\" versus variable routes.

We need to find out first the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM since we know he was moving continuously without breaks during this period.
