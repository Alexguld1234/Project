Let x represent walking speed. Running speed would then be 4x. Skipping speed would be 2(4x) or 8x. Since we don't know these values, let's set them up proportionally instead. We use proportions because we're dealing with ratios (running to skipping speeds). So, if walking takes longer, it means its value is smaller; similarly, running which is faster than walking must also take less time, meaning larger value compared to walking. Therefore, running speed > skipping speed > walking speed. It doesn't matter what exact numbers you assign, so long as they respect this order, your conclusion remains valid. For instance, let's say walking is 1 hour per mile, then running would be 0.25 hours per mile (or 1/4 of an hour), while skipping would remain unchanged since it's only 2 times slower than running.", "value": 0.5}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Now let's calculate Dana's travel distance based on our calculations! Firstly, Dana's walking speed is 1 mph. This implies that the speed of running is 4mph. Since the skipping speed is twice as slow as running, it equates to 2mph. To find out how far she can go in six hours, considering she spends one third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the time spent on running and walking respectively. One-third of 6 hours equals 2 hours. Two-thirds of 6 hours equals 4 hours.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the distance covered during the running and walking period separately. During running, cover a distance of 4 mph * 2 h = 8 miles. During walking, cover a distance of 1 mph * 4 h = 4 miles.
