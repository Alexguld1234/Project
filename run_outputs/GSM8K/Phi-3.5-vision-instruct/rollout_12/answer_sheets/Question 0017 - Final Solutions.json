To find her total weekly earnings, we add her earnings as a teacher and as a coach together. This sum equals $700 (as a teacher) + $450 (as a coach) = $<<700+450=1150>>1150. Since Jill works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary would be her weekly earnings multiplied by the number of work weeks in a year. Therefore, her annual salary is $1150 * 50 weeks = $<<1150*50=57500>>57500.
