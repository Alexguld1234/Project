The answer is: 1000.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {"1": "Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate what this would look like over the course of a year. Firstly, let's determine the additional amount required per month due to the increase: 50% of 1000 is 500. Then, adding this to the original minimum payment amounts results in new monthly payments as follows: 300 (student loan) + 200 (credit card) + 500 (mortgage) + 500 (additional amount). This totals to 1500 per month. Multiplying this amount by 12 months yields 18000.

First, let's calculate the additional amount Jessica would need to pay above the minimum due to wanting to pay 50% more. This means adding half of her current minimum repayments to them. So we multiply each of her minimum payments (student loans $300, credit card $200, mortgage $500) by 1.5 (which represents the original amount plus an additional 50%). This results in: Student Loans: 300 * 1.5 = $450; Credit Card: 200 * 1.5 = $300; Mortgage: 500 * 1.5 = $750. Now, let's sum these new amounts to get her total minimum payments when including the additional 50%.
