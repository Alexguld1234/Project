Since each outcome (even numbers) has an equal chance, we use combinations here rather than dice.

The calculation yields \\( C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15 \\). However, since only half of these combinations include an odd number, we get 7.5 successful combinations per roll (since one of the combinations would involve throwing both even numbers consecutively if rolled back to back, but we don\u2019t care about order). Thus, the average success rate per roll for two consecutive evens is \\( \\frac{7.5}{1} = 7.5 \\) times more likely.

First, find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll. There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, or 6) out of six possible numbers. Therefore, the probability is 3/6 or 1/2 (50%). Next, let's consider rolling two even numbers in a row. Each side of the die shows either an even number or an odd number; thus, every pair (e.g., 2-2, 2-4, etc.) has an equal probability of occurring. Given there are 3 even sides, there are \\( \\binom{6}{2} = 15 \\) pairs overall. Half of them consist of even numbers, which means 7.5 successful pairs occur when rolling two even numbers in sequence. The probability of rolling two even numbers is therefore 7.5.\n\nNow, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of getting a number greater than 3:\n\n\\( P(\\text{number > 3}) - P(\\text{two evens}) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{7.5}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} - 7.5 = -\\frac{14.5}{2} = -7.25 \\).\n\nHowever, negative probabilities make no sense, so I made an error. It appears my mistake was in considering all combinations without accounting for the fact that not all combinations result in even doubles. Let's try recalculating properly while considering the correct conditions for our second event, i.e., determining sequences involving exactly two even numbers in succession out of several rolls.\n\nSince Jerry rolls two dice sequentially and both must land on even numbers, the first even number has a probability of \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) (because there are 3 even faces on a standard die). The second roll also needs to be even due to the condition specified, making its probability also \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). The probability of these two specific events happening together (in succession) is therefore \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\). This probability represents the fraction of scenarios under consideration that satisfy the constraint imposed by two sequential even results within two rolls.\n\nTo compare directly, note that rolling any number other than a multiple of 2 cannot occur in conjunction with the requirement set forth regarding two even numbers. Hence, any individual roll of the second dice that isn't doubled would inherently violate the conditions stipulated\u2014a contradiction arises here since the task specifies that only even numbers can follow another even number. Therefore, the comparison rests solely on the initial scenario of rolling any number greater than 3, regardless of subsequent constraints.\n\nTherefore, based on accurate calculations following sound logic, the conclusion stands unchanged.

Firstly, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 which means rolling a 4 or a 5, so 2 outcomes favorable out of 6 possible outcomes, thus 2/6 or approximately 33.33%.\n\nSecondly, we need to calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6), but only 2 ways to place them consecutively (as 24 or 42). So this would result in 2 outcomes favorable over 6 possible sequences leading to a pair, hence 2/6*6= 2/6 or about 33.33% chance of getting just one sequence without repeating any number.
