Since 2/5 of the students are boys, it means that 3/5 of the students are girls because all parts add up to whole which is 1 or 5/5. So if 80 boys represent 2/5 of the student population, then 1 boy represents 2/5 / 80 = 1/160th of the entire grade. Therefore, one girl would also represent 1/160th of the entire grade since only the number of boys affects their share relative to the girls. To find the initial number of girls, multiply 1/160th of the grade by 160 to get the full count: 160 * (1/160) = 1. Hence, there was 120 girls as hint 2 says.\nNow we need to calculate the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts. According to hint 2, 2/3 of the girls are in Girl Scouts. This means that 1/3 of the girls are not in Girl Scouts. The calculation goes like this: 120 * (1/3) = 40.
