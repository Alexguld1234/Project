This means she actually stops three times before reaching shore.\n\nThe boat fills up twice as fast when she gets home than when she's out on the lake due to fixing leaks at home compared to the lake. Therefore, whenever she gets home, instead of filling up at 2L/10ft speed, she fills up at 4L/10ft speed.\n\nNext, let's calculate the amount of water she gets when coming home versus the lakeside. Since she gets filled at half speed, double the rate she gets at the lakeside.\n\nFirstly, considering the fact that she spends about 16 seconds in each part of the journey, but stops 4 times during these journeys.\nFor the lake route (3 parts), if you consider she only stops in the middle portion, that is roughly 1/3 of the way. Whenever she leaves the lake route, assuming 2 liters of water enters into her boat every 10 feet she covers, i.e., halfway through 20 feet, meaning she fills about 1 L/foot, approximately 1 Liter.\nFor the second part of the journey, until she reaches the final point around 11 feet, she still fills about 2 liters worth of water into her boat.\nSo in total, when traveling the lake route; she would fill her boat with almost 4 liters of water, approximately 4 Liters of water.\nSince she gets fuller at home, meaning faster than the lake, she would fill her boat with 8 liters of water.\n\nNow calculating for the total amount of water pumped into the boat when coming home, knowing that it fills at twice the rate it fills up on the lake route, then multiplying the lake route's 4L by two, we get that it equals to 8 liters of water.
