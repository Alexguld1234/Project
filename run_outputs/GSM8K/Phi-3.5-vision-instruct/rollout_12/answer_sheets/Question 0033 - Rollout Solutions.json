Let's call the number of silver coins S and the number of gold coins G. According to the problem statement, we can write this as equation: G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver ones). Also, according to the problem statement, it states that the total number of coins is 110, so we can also write another equation: S + G = 110. We need to solve these simultaneous equations to find out the values of S and G. To simplify solving them, let's substitute one variable into the other equation using the first equation. Substituting G = S + 30 into S + G = 110 gives us S + (S + 30) = 110, which simplifies down to 2S + 30 = 110. Solving this equation gives us 2S = 110 - 30, so 2S = 80 and dividing both sides by 2 gives us S = 40. Now we use our value of S back into G = S + 30 to get G = 40 + 30, so G = 70.
