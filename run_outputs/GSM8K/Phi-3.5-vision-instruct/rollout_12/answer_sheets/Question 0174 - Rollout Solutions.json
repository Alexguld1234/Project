Firstly, we know that it takes Billy 30 seconds to peel every potato. This doesn't change regardless of whether or not he also cuts them beforehand. Since the problem states that he spends the same amount of time (about 30 seconds) to peel each potato without regard to cutting, our calculation remains simple because both tasks \u2014 peeling and cutting \u2014 contribute equally to the overall time spent on each individual potato.\n\nSo even though cutting each potato adds another 5 seconds onto the initial 30 seconds of peeling, since these times are 'roughly equal,' as mentioned in the question, we can assume that the total additional time required just for cutting each potato would still result in the same average time spent per potato which is stated to be 30 seconds. Therefore, Billy spends 30 seconds to peel each potato plus 5 seconds to cut it out, equalling exactly 35 seconds per potato when considering cutting too. But remember, the original assumption was that it always took Billy precisely 30 seconds to peel each potato. Since this information wasn\u2019t specifically contradicted elsewhere in the question, we stick with it.\n\nNow let's calculate the total time Billy needs to spend peeling all his potatoes. There are 60 potatoes, and each requires 30 seconds of work, resulting in a total of 60 * 30 seconds = 1800 seconds. Converting this back into minutes involves dividing the total seconds by 60, yielding approximately 30 minutes. However, this interpretation might slightly underestimate the time actually needed, due to the potential inconsistency introduced by the slight discrepancy in assumed and actual task durations.\n\nConsidering what could have possibly happened during the process (like changes in speed due to fatigue etc.), it is difficult to say definitively whether the true average duration exceeds or falls short of 30 seconds solely based on the provided details. Thus, for the sake of simplicity and avoidance of any ambiguity in interpreting Billy's actions throughout the task, we adhere to the given factual data i.e., the average time taken to peel each potato being 30 seconds.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?", "subanswer": {"text": "Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare, taking an average of 30 seconds to peel each potato.
