Firstly, let's confirm how long it takes Mark to finish all questions based on his answering speed. We know he can answer about 5 questions every hour because the entire 75-question test would require 75 / (1/12) = 900 minutes, so indeed, 900 / 15 = 60 hours which fits our initial conditions perfectly. Now onto the actual calculation: For the first test, he answered 75 questions in 6 hours, meaning he needed 75 / 5 = 15 hours overall to complete the test according to his pace. With only 8 hours available, he finished 8 * 5 = 40 questions. Therefore, he didn't manage to finish all of them before the time ran out. The same goes for the second test; although he had enough time (6 * 5 = 30), he completed exactly what he managed in the first case, thus not leaving any question unfinished either. The hint confirms this scenario. Thus, Mark did not leave any questions incomplete.

This equals 6 hours, as stated in the problem."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how quickly Mark can complete tests based on your hint. If he answers questions at a rate of 5 questions every hour, which means it takes him 1/5th of an hour to answer each one, this tells us he could solve all 75 questions within 75 / (1/5), or 375/5, which simplifies down to 75 hours. But you said it only took him 8 hours! So perhaps, although unconventional, our friend Mark works overtime to finish tasks faster than others might expect\u2014or maybe there\u2019s something wrong with my math\u2026 Let's assume he worked extra hard those 8 hours and just finished exactly what was required without going into overtime. With these additional 8 hours, he would still be able to answer 5 questions per hour because he's already using them up so fast. So, in reality, even working 8 hours at a pace of 5 questions per hour, he wouldn't manage to solve any more questions beyond what's required since he used up all available time answering questions. Thus, he answered the full 75 questions during the standard test duration.\n\nNow, onto the second test of 100 questions at the same speed\u2014he needs 2 hours to complete this test (100 / 5 = 20; noting though that the division here is slightly different due to rounding). So, considering both tests, he worked for 8 hours on the first and 6 hours on the second, totalling 14 hours spent testing altogether. Since 100 / 5 equals exactly 20, but he took only 6 hours rather than the maximum possible 14 hours, he had to stop partway through the last question before completing it fully within the provided timeframe, leaving him with 100 \u2013 (20 \u00d7 6) = 100 \u2013 120 = -20. But remember, he cannot lose points or go below zero. Therefore, technically speaking, we must say that at the very least, Mark answered 100 questions of the second test completely, as he didn't have enough time to start on the remaining ones.
