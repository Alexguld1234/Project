We know from Condition 2 that we can expect 1/4 of the guests won't come. Since Christina invited 16 guests (from Condition 3), one fourth of them means that potentially 16 * 1/4 = 4 fewer guests might show up. However, since we want the maximum possible, let\u2019s assume all 16 will indeed come (which is our worst-case scenario due to the potential for 4 not showing up as mentioned).\n\n2. Now, considering Condition 1, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per person. With the 16 expected guests, we multiply 16 guests times 0.75 bags to find out how many bags she needs: 16 * 0.75 = 12 gift bags.\n\n3. Each bag costs $2 according to Condition 4. So if she buys 12 gift bags, she will spend 12 * $2 = $24.\n\nBut remember, since we assumed everyone might come, even though it was stated one quarter may not arrive, you asked about spending less than what Condition 4 states ($2 each). Let's do another calculation assuming no one shows up because the maximum number of people might attend which is stated in Condition 2. This will also result in a lower amount spent but still aligning with our previous logic for the worst case.\n\nSo instead of calculating for the exact 12, we calculate for the 12 * 0.75 = 9 bags just in case every invitee shows up (as hinted earlier):\n\n9 * $2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, under the worst-case scenario where all 16 guests might actually turn up, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.", "value": 0.75}}}, "rollout_id": 5}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
