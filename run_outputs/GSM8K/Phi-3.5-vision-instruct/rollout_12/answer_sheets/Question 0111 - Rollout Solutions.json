Firstly, since it took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, we can calculate the number of stops she made due to fixing the leaky boat by dividing the total distance travel time (in seconds) by the duration it takes for each section of rowing covered by Julia before stopping. Given it took her 64 seconds, divided by 16 seconds per section results in 4 sections or stops for leaks. Each stop caused 2 liters of water to enter because each 20 feet segment adds another 2 liters when Julia stopped, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 liters per stop. With four stops, a total of 4 * 4 = 16 liters entered the boat over its journey toward the shore.
