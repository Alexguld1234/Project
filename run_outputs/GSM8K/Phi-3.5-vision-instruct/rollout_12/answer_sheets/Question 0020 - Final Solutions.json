First we need to find out how much water is in each type of drink before we mix them together. For the orange drink, we calculate (2/3) * 10 = 6.67 liters. For the pineapple drink, we calculate (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters. However, since 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, only 9 liters of the orange drink is mixed into the pineapple drink. When combining the drinks, the total amount of water would be 6.67 liters (from the orange drink) plus 9 liters (from the pineapple drink), which equals 15.67 liters.

First, calculate the volume of water in both drinks separately. For the orange drink: 10 liters * (2/3) = 6.67 liters of water. For the pineapple drink: 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters of water. Add these amounts together before the accidental spillage: 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water. Subtract one liter due to the spillage: 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water remaining.
