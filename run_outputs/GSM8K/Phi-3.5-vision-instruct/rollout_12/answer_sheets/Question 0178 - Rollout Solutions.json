Let's say Monic has 'M' crabs. Rani has M + 10 crabs. Bo has M + 4 crabs (since Monic has 4 less). Since we don't know how many crabs Monic or Bo has, let's find out how many more crabs Rani needs to make them equal before adding the ten extra for Rani. We can compare Monic and Bo directly since both need to reach Rani\u2019s count first. If Bo is one full crab ahead, then when adding Rani's extra crabs, it equals twice what Monic would have if she gained those same additional crabs back again plus one more. To solve this, assuming Bo also doesn't gain any crabs until their comparison, we set up the equation M+10+M=2(M)+4+1. This simplifies to 2M+10=2M+5. Subtracting 2M from both sides leaves us with just 10=5. However, as stated earlier, we cannot determine Monic's exact number without knowing either Rani's or Bo's counts separately, but based on our calculation, even though all numbers seem correct individually according to given information, the initial assumption about Rani having exactly 10 more crabs might not hold true due to incomplete data.
