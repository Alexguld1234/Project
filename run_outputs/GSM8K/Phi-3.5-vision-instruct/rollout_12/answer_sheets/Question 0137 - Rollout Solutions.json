To determine these extra costs, you first convert the percentage into its decimal form by dividing it by 100, so 20% becomes 0.20. You then multiply this value by the initial sum of all products, thus finding the cost of the delivery fee, which would be 0.20 times $20.00, resulting in $4.00. Finally, the total cost comes together when you add both these amounts to the original cost of the products, leading us to conclude that the final amount due for Rory's order totals $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $<<20+4+5=29.00>>29.00.
