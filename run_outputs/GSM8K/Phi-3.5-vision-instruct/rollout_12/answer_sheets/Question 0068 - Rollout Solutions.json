Firstly, let\u2019s calculate the number of boys based on the amount of girls: 60 girls mean there are twice as many boys which equals 120 boys. Next, I\u2019ll calculate the number of students in these three classes: in the first two classes there are four (and therefore) eight students because there are 5 kids per teacher \u2013 i.e., 4 times 5. And finally, the third class has just half as many students compared to those first ones due to the fact that this class doesn\u2019t yet fill up its whole capacity; hence 8/2 equals 4, not 5. Therefore, combining everything together results in 20 (first class) plus another 20 (second class), making it 40.

Dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher yields us the number of teachers needed, which comes out to be 41 / 5 or 8 remainder 1.
