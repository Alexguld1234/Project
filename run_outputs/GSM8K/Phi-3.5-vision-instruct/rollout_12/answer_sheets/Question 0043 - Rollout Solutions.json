So, if you want to calculate the exact amount of grams that corresponds to these few extra calories, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the weight difference based on calorie difference between desired goal and current consumption:\n   2000 - 1800 = 200 calories needed\n   Since each serving is 250 calories, divide 200 by 250 to get: 0.8 servings\n\n2.
