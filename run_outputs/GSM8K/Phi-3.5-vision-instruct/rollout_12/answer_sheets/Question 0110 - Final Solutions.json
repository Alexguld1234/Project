Marcell received 24 fruit roll-ups instead of 22 due to a mistake. That means he should have only 22 fruit roll-ups.\n\nFor Marcell, since we know exactly what was supposed to happen without any other data suggesting otherwise, he consumed all 22 fruit roll-ups.\n\nBeatrice's roll-up initially contained 52 fruit roll-ups when she should have only received 26. This suggests she overconsumed by 52 - 26 = 26 fruit roll-ups.\n\nAdding up both the correct amounts and the differences, we get 22 (Marcell\u2019s) + 26 (Beatrice's extra amount) = 48 fruit roll-ups consumed correctly or not intended to be eaten.\n\nTo find the average consumption per person, divide this total count by 2 people (Marcell and Beatrice): 48 / 2 = 24 fruit roll-ups each on average.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
