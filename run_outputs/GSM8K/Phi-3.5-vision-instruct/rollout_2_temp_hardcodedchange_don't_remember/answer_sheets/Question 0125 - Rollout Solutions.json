She didn't start with any because she bought a new package (we don't know this amount yet). Her husband contributed 5 spoons. And she used 3 spoons while sampling the stew. This means before using those 3 spoons, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons available. Since we need to account for both her husband's contribution and what she initially bought, we subtract the 5 contributed by her husband to find out about the initial purchase: 15 - 5 equals 10 spoons.
