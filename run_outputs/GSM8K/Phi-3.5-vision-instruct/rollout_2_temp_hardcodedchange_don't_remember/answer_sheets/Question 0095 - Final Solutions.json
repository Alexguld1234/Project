We know that 2/5 of the students are boys, so we multiply 2/5 by the total number of students, which is 200. (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys. This means there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls. Now, since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we need to find out what 1/3 represents as it would indicate the percentage of girls who aren't in the girl scout. To find 1/3 of the girls, we divide 120 by 3, resulting in 40 girls. Therefore, there are 40 girls not in the girl scout.
