[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the fuel efficiency rate. Her tank holds 12 gallons when full, but we need to know how much gas she used to travel 100 miles. We'll calculate this first.", "2": "Calculate the miles per gallon ratio by dividing the distance driven so far (100 miles) by the amount of gas used (4 gallons). So, her car gets 100 / 4 = 25 miles per gallon.", "3": "Calculate how many miles she could drive if the tank was completely filled at its capacity (12 gallons * 25 mpg). So, she could drive 12 * 25 = 300 miles on a full tank of gas.", "4": "The answer is 300.", "5": "Since she drove 100 miles before refilling the tank and got 25 mpg, she effectively has consumed 4 gallons less than what she needs to get back to full tank. Therefore, on one full tank of gas, she can still drive an additional 12 - 4 = 8 gallons worth of driving. Thus, Sophia can drive an extra 8 gallons * 25 mpg = 200 miles beyond the initial 100 miles."}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas.
