Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?", "ost_step": {"1": "Find the dimensions of each box inside the wall. To get the inner dimensions, we need to subtract the thickness of one wall twice because it will cover two sides of the box. For example, for length: Length outside is 5 inches, so the length inside is 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 inches. For width: Width outside is 6 inches, so the width inside is 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 inches. For height: Height outside is 4 inches, so the height inside is 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 inches.", "2": "Calculate the volume of one inner box using its inner dimensions.

Subtracting the thickness once gets us the inside dimensions which are: length = 3 inches, width = 4 inches, height = 2 inches. Next, calculate the inner volume of one box: volume = length * width * height = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 cubic inches per box. Lastly, since John has 3 such boxes, multiply the single box volume by three to find the total inner volume: 3 boxes * 24 cubic inches/box = 72 cubic inches. The answer is: 72.", "value": 0.84375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
