First, let's find out how many pineapples John produces in one cycle (which is 3 months). With 10 hectares of land and 100 pineapples per hectare, John gets 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples every 3 months. Next, we need to calculate how many such cycles occur in a year. Since one full cycle takes 3 months, there are 12 / 3 = 4 complete cycles in a year. To find the total number of pineapples harvested over these 4 cycles, we multiply the production per cycle by the number of cycles: 1000 pineapples/cycle * 4 cycles = 4000 pineapples.

First, we identify the information provided: John owns 10 hectares of pineapple fields, which yields 100 pineapples per hectare.
