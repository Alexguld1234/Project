Since Tuesday's count was 2/5 times more than Monday's, and she wrote 5 articles on Monday, this means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Next, we know that on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which would mean she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday. To find out the total number of articles written over the three days, we add up Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's totals: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles. Each article requires 4 hours to research and write about, so the total time spent writing articles is 26 * 4 = 104 hours.
