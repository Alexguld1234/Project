Firstly, since Brian initially had 20 video games and lost 5, he only had 20 - 5 = 15 video games when the comparison was made. Secondly, let us denote the number of video games Bobby has as B. According to the information given, B = 3 * (number of video games Brian has) - 5. We can substitute the known value into this equation: B = 3 * 15 - 5. So, B = 45 - 5 which equals 40. Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.
