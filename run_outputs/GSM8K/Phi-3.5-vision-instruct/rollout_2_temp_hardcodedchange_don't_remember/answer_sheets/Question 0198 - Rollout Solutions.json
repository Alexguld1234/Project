Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards. First month, she collected 3 times the original amount, so 20 * 3 = 60 cards. Second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Combined first and second months, she had 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Third month, she collected twice this combined total, so 100 * 2 = 200 cards. Total cards now = initial + first + second + third months collections. So, 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.
