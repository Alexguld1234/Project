Since there are twice as many babies than queens, we can say if Q represents the number of queen bees, then B = 2Q would represent the number of baby bees. And WB = 2B because there are twice as many worker bees than babies. We know that all these add up to 700 bees, so Q + B + WB = 700. Substituting B and WB with their expressions in terms of Q, we get Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700. This simplifies to Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 or 7Q = 700. Dividing both sides by 7, we find Q = 100. Now since B = 2Q = 2*100 = 200, and WB = 2B = 2*200 = 400, but this exceeds our count of bees (700), indicating the initial relationship might not hold true for the entire set of bees. Hence, let\u2019s correct it considering only the total bees available, which means we need to find Q such that 700 = 100 + 200 + WB. That implies WB = 700 - 300 = 400.

Let W represent the number of worker bees, B represents the number of baby bees, and Q stands for the number of queen bees. We know that W = 2B and B = 2Q. We also know that W + B + Q = 700. Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get W + 2Q + Q = 700 or W + 3Q = 700. Since W = 2B and B = 2Q, W can be replaced with 4Q.
