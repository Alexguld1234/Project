Sylvie earns $600 per month initially. That means her annual salary would be $600 * 12 months = $7200.\n2. Since Sylvie has been staying in the company for five years without any increase yet, her current salary remains $7200.\n3. Each year, Sylvie gets a raise of 10% (or 0.10) times her original salary ($600), which is $600 * 0.10 = $60 extra annually.\n4. If Sylvie continues working for another three years, her total raises amount to 3 years * $60/year = $180 additional yearly increments.\n5. Adding these incremental increases to her existing salary, we get $7200 + $180 = $7380 as her new annual salary.\n\nSo after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $7380.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month.
