Let's call the original amount of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as 'x'. When she sold a third of them at the green house, she had (2/3)x left. Selling another two at the red house leaves her with (2/3)x - 2. Half of what was left would mean dividing this quantity by 2, so we get ((2/3)x - 2)/2 left. We know that this equals 5 vacuum cleaners because it says she has 5 left. Therefore, we can solve this equation:\n((2/3)x - 2)/2 = 5\nMultiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:\n(2/3)x - 2 = 10\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n(2/3)x = 12\nMultiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:\nx = 18\nSo, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
