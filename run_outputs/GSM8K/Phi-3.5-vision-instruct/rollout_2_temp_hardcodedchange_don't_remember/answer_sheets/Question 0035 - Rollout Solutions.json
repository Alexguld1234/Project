During the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. For the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than this, which equals 0.25 * 4 = 1 additional point. So during these 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points. Adding both sets of points together, Mike scored 4 (first set) + 5 (second set), so 4 + 5 = 9 points in total.
