For the second test with 100 questions also at a rate of 5 questions per hour, it will take him 100 / 5 = 20 hours to finish.

Firstly, calculate how many questions Mark could finish during the first test within the allotted time frame using his completion rate (5 questions/hour). Mark had 8 hours and finished 40 questions in those hours because 5 * 8 equals 40. Subtract this from the initial quantity of 75 to determine how many questions remained undone from the first test: 75 minus 40 is 35, meaning there were still 35 questions awaiting review or completion. Next, evaluate how many questions he could address during the following test session. With 6 hours available and a consistent pace, he managed to work through 30 questions since 5 multiplied by 6 results in 30. Subtraction reveals how many problems remain without resolution post the second assessment: 35 minus 30 equates to 5. Therefore, Mark had 5 questions left over which went unanswered after both tests were completed. The answer is: 5.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
