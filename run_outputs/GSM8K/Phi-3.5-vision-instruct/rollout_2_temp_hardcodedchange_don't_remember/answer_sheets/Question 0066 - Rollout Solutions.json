Firstly, let's find out how many people go to each school. One basketball team has 5 players and needs a coach, which totals 5 + 1 = 6 people. Secondly, another basketball team also has 5 players and needs a coach, adding up to another 6 people. So this makes a total of 2 basketball teams, meaning 12 people (6 per team) going to each school. Four schools mean 4 x 12 = 48 people. The hint says these are 'all of the schools', not just the participants, but our calculation only considers those who play; any other staff or students cannot be included because no such information is provided. So the full, precise answer can be confidently given without guessing additional information.
