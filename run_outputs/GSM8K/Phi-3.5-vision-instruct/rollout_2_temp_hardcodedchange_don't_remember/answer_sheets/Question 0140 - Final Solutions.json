We know there are a total of 20 cars and 12 of them are automatic. To find out how many are semi-automatic, we subtract the number of automatic cars from the total number of cars: 20 - 12 = 8 semi-automatic cars. To calculate the percentage, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100: (8 / 20) * 100 = 40%.
