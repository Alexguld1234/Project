Since all chickens receive the same amount of feed throughout the day (assuming), and we know there are 20 chickens in the flock, we can calculate the total daily consumption as 20 chickens x 40 cups per chicken = 800 cups of feed needed daily. Since the problem states that Wendi starts with enough feed for one full day before running out completely, these 800 cups represent the entire stock she has available during one complete cycle of feeding (morning + afternoon). Thus, every single chicken receives the equivalent of half of its daily ration in both segments \u2014 which was previously established to be 15 cups of feed per chicken.
