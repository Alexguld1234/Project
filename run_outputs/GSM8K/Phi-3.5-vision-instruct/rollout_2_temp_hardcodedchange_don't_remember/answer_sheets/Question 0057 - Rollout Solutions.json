First, let's find out the available weight space for the boxes. We know the initial weight including the driver but without any box: 3755 pounds. Subtracting it from the bridge's limit: 5000 - 3755 leaves us with 1245 pounds for the boxes. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so dividing the available weight space by the weight of one box gives us: 1245 / 15 = 83.
