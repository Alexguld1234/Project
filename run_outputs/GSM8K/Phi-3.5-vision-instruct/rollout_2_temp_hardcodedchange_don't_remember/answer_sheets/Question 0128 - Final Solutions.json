We know that each pepper costs 15$, so we can use this information to calculate the cost of other fruits based on the hint provided. According to the hint, a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper. Therefore, one watermelon costs 45$. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, which means it costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$.
