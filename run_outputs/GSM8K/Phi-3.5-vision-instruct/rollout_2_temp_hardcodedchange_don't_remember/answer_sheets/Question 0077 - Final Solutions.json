We know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, who does 4 times as much laundry as David. First, let's find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we divide the amount of laundry Sarah does (which is 400 pounds) by 4. That means David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.\n\nNow, since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we take the amount of laundry Sarah does (which is 400 pounds), and divide it by 2 to get Raymond's laundry amount. So Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.\n\nTo find the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do, we subtract the smaller amount (David's laundry) from the larger one (Raymond's).
