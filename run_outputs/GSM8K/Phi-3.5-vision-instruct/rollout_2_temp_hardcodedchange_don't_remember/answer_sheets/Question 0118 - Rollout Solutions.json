Initially, we know there were 2 containers \u00d7 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles. On the second day, the count increased to a total of 30 vehicles. This means there were 30 - 10 = 20 additional vehicles. Since each container holds 5 vehicles, this indicates that there were 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 new containers.
