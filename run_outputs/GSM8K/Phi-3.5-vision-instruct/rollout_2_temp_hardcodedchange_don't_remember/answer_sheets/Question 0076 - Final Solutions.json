First, calculate how many cups of dog food are needed for the initial 180 days: 180 days * 1 cup per day = 180 cups. Next, find out how many days remain in the first year (assuming it's not specified): 365 days - 180 days = 185 days. Calculate the daily requirement post 180 days: 2 cups per day. Multiply 2 cups/day by 185 days remaining: 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups. Add both amounts together: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

First, let's find out how many times Cecilia needs to refill the cup to complete the first 180 days (because she feeds her puppy once daily). This can be calculated as follows: 180 / 1 = 180. Next, we multiply this result by the amount of food per cup which equals 180*1 = 180. Thus, Cecilia uses 180 cups of dog food during these initial 180 days. Given that one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed within the first year is calculated by dividing the total cups used by the contents of one bag, i.e., 180/110 = 1.636. Therefore, Cecilia requires approximately 2 full bags of dog food within the first year since any fractional part indicates that you would need to open another bag even if it doesn't completely fill the last bag. However, in such cases, the amount remaining cannot exceed what was contained in the fully opened bag because the question asks about complete usage, hence, we round down to get the number of bags required.
