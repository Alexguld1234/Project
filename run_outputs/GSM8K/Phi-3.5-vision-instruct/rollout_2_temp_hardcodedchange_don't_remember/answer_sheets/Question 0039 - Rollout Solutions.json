We know Dana skips at 3 mph and runs at twice this speed, so she runs at 6 mph. Walking at speed four times slower means she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 mph. To find out how far she can go during the running period, we multiply speed (6) by time (2). This equals 12 miles. During the walking part, which lasts for 4 hours, we multiply speed (1.5) by time (4), which results in 6 miles. Adding these distances together, Dana covers 12 + 6 = 18 miles in six hours.
