The two girls together got 1/6 of 24 liters each, which is 4 liters each. So in total, they got 8 liters combined. Adding the boy's 6 liters, we have 8 + 6 = 14 liters taken out of the original 24 liters. To find out how much was left, subtract this sum from the original amount: 24 - 14 = 10 liters remaining.
