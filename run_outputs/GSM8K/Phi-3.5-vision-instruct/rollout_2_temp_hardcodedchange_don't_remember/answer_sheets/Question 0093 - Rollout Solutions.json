Before condition 2, Lee was 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee ran it in 38 seconds, this means Gerald's previous time would have been 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Lee ran the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds while being 2 seconds slower than Gerald. Without considering Gerald's improvement, if Gerald ran it in less time, let's say T seconds, then Lee ran it in T + 2 seconds. We know Lee ran it in 38 seconds, so T + 2 = 38. To find out T (Gerald's original time), subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: T = 38 - 2 = 36 seconds. The hint tells us not to consider Gerald's diet improvement.
