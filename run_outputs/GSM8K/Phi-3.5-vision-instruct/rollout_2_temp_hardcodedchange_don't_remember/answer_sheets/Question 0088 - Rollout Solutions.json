This means Marilyn's sales figure would be 10x because she sold 10 times as many copies as Harald did. Together, their sales figures add up to 88,000.

We know that Marilyn's sales figure is 10 times Harald's (10x), and when we combine them, it equals 88,000. Adding those together, we get 11x, since you can't simplify further than what we already simplified. We replace that into our original equation so we have 11x = 88,000. To find out how much 'x', or Harald's sales figure is, we divide both sides of the equation by 11, resulting in x = 88,000 / 11. When divided, we get x = 8,000. Since the question asks only for the value of 'x', which represents Harald's sales figure, the answer is: 8,000.", "value": 0.4}, "ost_step": {"1": "The answer is 8,000."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's say Harald sold H copies. Marilyn sold 10H copies (since it was ten times as many). Combined, they sold H + 10H = 11H copies. We know that together they sold 88,000 copies, so 11H = 88,000. Dividing both sides by 11, we get H = 8,000.
