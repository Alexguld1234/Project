On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles, which means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles. Adding up Monday and Tuesday, we get 4 + 24 = 28 miles. Since the total from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles, subtracting the first two days from this total gives us 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday. The answer is: 13.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
