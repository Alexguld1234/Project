Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She puts one quarter of them on the board, which means she put out 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. This leaves 750 pieces remaining. Her mom then takes a third of those, which is 750 / 3 = approximately 250 pieces. However, since you cannot place a fraction of a puzzle piece, it rounds down to 250. Therefore, Poppy has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to place.
