We know Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of attendees don't show up, we need to calculate this first. To find out how many people will not attend, multiply the total number of invited guests by 1/4. In this case, it would be 16 * 1/4 = 4. This means 4 friends won't show up for the party. Hence, subtract these 4 friends from the total number invited. 16 - 4 equals 12 guests attending the party."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.

Firstly, we need to calculate if all 16 friends attend. Since 1/4 of attendees might not show up, that means 1/4 * 16 = 4 friends might not come. So, potentially 16 - 4 = 12 friends could attend. For these 12 potential attendees, Christina needs 12 * .75 = 9 gift bags (since one-third would be one third of 12 which equals 4 but since she needs three quarters it would be 9). At $2 per bag, Christina will spend 9 * 2 = $18 on gift bags. The answer is: $18.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
