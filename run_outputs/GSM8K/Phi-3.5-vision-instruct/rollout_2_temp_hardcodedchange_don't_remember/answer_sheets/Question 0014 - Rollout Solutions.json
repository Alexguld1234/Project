First, we find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 students (total) * 20% = 4 students. This leaves us with 20 - 4 = 16 students who didn't take up contemporary dance. Next, we determine the amount of students taking up jazz dance: 16 students (remaining) * 25% = 4 students. So, the number of students left would be 16 - 4 = 12 students. Since these are all the students who took up other forms of dancing, which includes hip-hop dance, it means 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To get the percentage out of the original 20 students, we divide 12 by 20 and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%. The answer is: 60%.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
