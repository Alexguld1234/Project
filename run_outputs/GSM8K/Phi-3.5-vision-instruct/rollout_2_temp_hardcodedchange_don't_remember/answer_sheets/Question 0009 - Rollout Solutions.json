So her regular wage is 40 * $10 = $400. Since she worked 45 hours, she worked 5 hours of overtime (45 - 40). Overtime pay is calculated as 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which means it's 1.2 * $10 = $12 per overtime hour. Therefore, her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60. Adding both amounts together, her total earnings are $400 + $60 = $460. The answer is: $460.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
