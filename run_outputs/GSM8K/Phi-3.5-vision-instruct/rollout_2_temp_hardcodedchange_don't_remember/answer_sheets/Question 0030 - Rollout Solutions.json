Darrell's age would then be 7x and Allen's age would be 11x. Together, 7x + 11x equals their combined current age which is 162. Therefore, 18x = 162. To find x, we divide both sides by 18, so x = 9. This means Allen's current age is 11x or 11 * 9 = 99 years old. Ten years from now, Allen would be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

First, we identify the sum of parts in their ratio which is 7 (for Darrell) plus 11 (for Allen), making it 18 parts. Since their total age is 162, we find the value of one part as 162 divided by 18, which equals 9 years per part. Allen\u2019s share of the age is represented by 11 parts because the ratio is 7:11. His current age is therefore 11 times the size of one part, so Allen is currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old. To find his age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.
