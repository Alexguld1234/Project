This indicates that John used all his earnings ($195) to pay for the video games because the expenditure was exactly matched by the earnings. To find out if he has any remaining Lego sets, since he made exactly enough to cover the cost of the games without any excess funds, it suggests that all the Lego sets were indeed sold off as planned.

So, the initial sum minus the video games expense equals what he had initially (before spending any money): $195 (from selling Lego) + $5 (remaining cash) = $200.

So, let's solve this equation: $195 - $5 = $190 (spent on video games) + $5.
