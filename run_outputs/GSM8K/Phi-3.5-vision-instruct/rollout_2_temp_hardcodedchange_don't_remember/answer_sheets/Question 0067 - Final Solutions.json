First, we find out the number of rubies which are 175 (diamonds) - 35 = 140 rubies. Then, since the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, it would be 140 x 2 = 280 emeralds. Adding up all the gem numbers together, we get 175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds). This equals to 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.
