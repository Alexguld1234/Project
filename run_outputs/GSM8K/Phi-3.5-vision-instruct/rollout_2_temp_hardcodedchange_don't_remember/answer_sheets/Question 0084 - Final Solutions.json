We know the total number of games played was 22 and the team won 8 more games than they lost. Let X represent the number of games they lost. Therefore, the team won X+8 games. Since these three events add up to 22 games played, we can set up the following equation based on the hint: X + X + 8 = 22. Simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms, which results in 2X + 8 = 22. Next, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable term, resulting in 2X = 14. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for X, giving us X = 7. This means the team lost 7 games. To find out how many games they won, we use the expression X+8 for winning games. Therefore, 7 + 8 equals 15 games won. So, the team won 15 games. The answer is: 15", "value": 0.84375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A football team played 22 games.
