At this point, he was still 180 miles away from home when he turned around. He spent the first 2 hours waiting in traffic (no distance covered), so we subtract these 2 hours from the remaining 4 hours he intended to travel, leaving us with 2 hours to cover the rest of the way. Within these 2 hours, he drove at 30 mph for 30 minutes or 0.5 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. This leaves him 1.5 hours to drive the remaining distance. Traveling at 80 mph for 1.5 hours covers 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles. Adding up all distances traveled, 180 + 15 + 120 equals 315 miles.
