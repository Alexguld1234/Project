Firstly, establishing relationships based on the hints provided. Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy (D). Since Charlie has 12 friends, it means 3D = 12, thus D = 12 / 3 = 4.

Firstly, using hint information we know that if Charlies friend count represents 3x, so Dorothy's would represent x. Since we know Charlies friend count (12) is equivalent to 3x, we get 12/3 = x. Solving this, we find out that x = 4. Therefore, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.\n\nNow let's move onto finding James's friend count. The problem states that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Hence, if we denote James's friend count as J, then J equates to 4D. Given that D = 4, it implies that J = 4*4.
