She slept 8 hours on Monday, but then slept 2 hours less each day, so 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours per night.", "2": "Calculate Sadie's sleep for these two specific days. Since it was mentioned as two consecutive days, we can calculate this separately or combine them into one calculation. In any case, since she slept 6 hours on both days, the combined total would still be 6 hours * 2 days = 12 hours over those two days."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 6 hours each (8 - 2). That adds up to 12 hours for those two days. From Thursday to Sunday, she sleeps 1 hour more than what she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday, which means she sleeps 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day. From Thursday to Sunday, that's four days. So, 7 hours/day * 4 days = 28 hours. Adding all together, she slept 8 hours + 12 hours + 28 hours = 48 hours in total during the week.
