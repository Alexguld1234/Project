Firstly, let's consider when Rosie was running at the faster speed (10 mph). She ran for 3 hours straight, covering 30 miles. Then she slowed down to 5 mph and kept running for another 4 hours, which equates to 20 miles. To find out how far she managed to go within those 7 hours in total, we just add together the two distances. Hence, 30 miles plus 20 miles is equal to 50 miles.
