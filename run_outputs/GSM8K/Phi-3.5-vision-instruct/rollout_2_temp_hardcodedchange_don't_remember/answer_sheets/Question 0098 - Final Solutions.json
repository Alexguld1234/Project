We know there were originally 30 cars. In the last part of the question, it states that 5 cars took an exit without driving through the traffic jam. That means only 30 - 5 = 25 cars remained for us to consider as having driven through the traffic jam within the specified times.\n\nOut of these 25 cars, we need to subtract the ones who didn't drive through the traffic jam during the time period in question (the first 15 minutes).\n\nWe can find this out because the hint tells us that all cars drove through the traffic jam eventually. Therefore, if there were 25 cars left when counting those who drove through during the last mentioned time, then all of these 25 would also have driven through earlier.\n\nSo, all 25 cars drove through the traffic jam during the first 15 minutes.

Initially, there were 30 cars. First, let's calculate how many cars exited before we consider those who went through: 5 cars took an exit. That leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars still in the jam. Of these, 20 cars can go through the rest of the traffic in the last 15 minutes while the other 5 cars, which included the ones who initially went through, must redo their journey without the exit. Therefore, since we know that all 20 cars eventually go through during the second part of the jam (as they cannot exit), it implies that all 5 cars who initially passed through also ended up going back into the queue, thus being counted again as not having gone through. This means no new car drove through just because of the exit. Thus, only the initial 20 cars that entered the jam within the first 15 minutes actually drove through.
