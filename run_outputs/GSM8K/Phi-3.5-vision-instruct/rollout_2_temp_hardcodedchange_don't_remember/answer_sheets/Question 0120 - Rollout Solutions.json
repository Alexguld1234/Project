Since he uses 2 pads of paper per week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets on each pad.

Each pad contains 30 sheets. Therefore, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets a week. Assuming there are roughly 4 weeks in a month, we multiply this weekly amount by 4. Thus, Miguel uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets in a month. The answer is 240.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing.
