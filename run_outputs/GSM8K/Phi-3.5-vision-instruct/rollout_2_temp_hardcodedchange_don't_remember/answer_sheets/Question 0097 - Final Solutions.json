Before being cooked down, one can of tomatoes equals 3 tomatoes at 16 ounces each, which means each can is 48 ounces. Since 16 ounces become 8 ounces once cooked (half), we need to find out what fractional part of a full can becomes sauce.\nWe know that Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, equivalent to 32 / 8 = 4 full portions of sauce made from a single can. Thus, four times the original amount of sauce comes from one whole can of tomatoes (before they get reduced).

Condition 1 states that one 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes. Since we know that the 16-ounce cans are what are used here, we start with 3 tomatoes per can. However, according to Condition 2, canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked down into sauce. Therefore, if we go backward, knowing that Freda made 32 ounces of sauce (Condition 3), we need to account for the reduced weight due to condensation. To find out the original amount before loss, we multiply the sauce weight by 2 (since it was halved): 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces. Now we have to convert these ounces back to 'cans' since we're working within the original unit system established by Condition 1. Given that one can is 16 ounces, sixteen ounces of sauce would correspond to one can which, under normal circumstances, holds 3 tomatoes. Thus, we have to determine how many sets of sixteen ounces are present in sixty-four ounces of sauce; therefore, we calculate 64 / 16 = 4 sets of sixty-four ounces, or 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each set contains 3 tomatoes, multiplying 4 cans by 3 tomatoes yields 12 tomatoes. The answer is: 12.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
