Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, 4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less, we subtract 2 from 500, getting 500 - 2 = 498 pounds. Now, add their weights together: 125 (Grace) + 498 (Alex) = 623 pounds. The answer is: 623.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
