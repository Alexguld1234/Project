Jill teaches 35 hours a week at $20 an hour, which equals 35 * 20 = $700 per week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, she makes 700 * 50 = $35,000 annually from teaching. As a cheerleading coach, she earns $30 an hour and works 15 hours a week, making 30 * 15 = $450 per week. Over 50 weeks, this adds up to 450 * 50 = $22,500.
