First, we need to calculate what 40% of a 200 GB file size would be because that's halfway through the download. We know that normally Carla could download at a rate of 2 GB per minute.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the 40% portion of the file size:\n40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB (This represents the amount of data downloaded before the interruption)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time it took to reach the 80 GB mark using Carla's normal speed:\n80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes needed without interruptions\n\nStep 3: Accounting for the 20-minute update installation delay:\nSince Carla was interrupted 40 minutes earlier than expected due to the update, only 20 minutes worth of download work has actually happened. This means:\n40 minutes expected - 20 minutes unexpectedly used up due to updating = 20 minutes still available for downloading\n\nNow subtract these 20 minutes from the total 80 GB to find out how much of the file has been transferred in those remaining 20 minutes.\n20 minutes * 2 GB/minute = 40 GB downloaded within the 20 minutes before the full 40 minutes were taken up by the Windows update.\n\nSo in conclusion, when Windows interrupts the download process mid-download, 40 GB of the file remains untransferred.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What percentage of the file has been downloaded if there was an interruption?", "subanswer": {"text": "Out of the required 200 GB, 80 GB were downloaded before the update and another 40 GB after the update resumed, making it 80 + 40 = 120 GB.
