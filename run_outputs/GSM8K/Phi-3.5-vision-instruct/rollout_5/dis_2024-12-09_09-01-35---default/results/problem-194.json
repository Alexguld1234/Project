We see here it works out well but would result also very closely spaced differences such as buying another small item etc.. Next smallest possible option divides evenly within range without leaving us anything short! To simplify our calculation process lets assume prices fall upon purchases... Suppose no discount exists initially hence only full price payment required . Total cost equals product quantity times unit selling rate thus summing products yields solution when multiplying quantities individually plus adding sums together instead calculating single expenses cumulatively thereby reducing computations significantly compared conventional approaches utilizing individual summation methods alone often requiring double effort just due arithmetic nature!.
