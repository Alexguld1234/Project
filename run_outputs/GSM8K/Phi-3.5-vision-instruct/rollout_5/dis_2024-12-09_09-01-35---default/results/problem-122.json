With only these three night\u2019s worth accounted for Sadie took half as long again Thursday through Sunday thus adding up to one extra full amount we can calculate this sum by dividing our first value into two equal sums like below :  (Monday & Tuesday Sleeping Total Hours / Number Of Days ) . This results us having ((8 + 6)/2).   Subtract away both sides just get((4))from here meaning sadies spent(12/4)=3 additional hours per Day during last four days starting Friday until Sunday inclusive , making them totalling together=(4days*3hrpDaytotalsom)(4*(3)). We add all values accordingly:- Monday Night :(8pm)-Tuesday:(6hrm)+Wednight:(6hms)+Thrusdnight+(3x3),(forthnight till sundown:(9hrms)). Adding All Values Equally Gives Us;SumofallNights:=8+6+6+(9+9+9)Simplifying Our Expression Will Give::Sumtotal_nights=sumOfAllNights===>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =========&&nbsp; SumTotalHourssummedUpToThisDate================<|end_of_text|>**",
        " Wednesday too; sadly it was also decreased again so this time it would be another subtraction instead (which amounts into addition) but first let us calculate all three as shown below according to their sequence pertaining order:",
        " 6 (8 - 2) hours on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. That\u2019s 6+6=12 hours over these three nights. Let N represent normal amount which equals 6; hence Thu, Fri & Sat equal N+1 or 7 per night so totalling up we would get (N)+(N+(1))*(3)=total nite time spent asleep.. Simplifying this equation yields us\u20267+7+7+12=(7*4+12).

Wednesday was also another day when she would get just these additional (i.e., fewer) 2 hours off so we calculate it as well; thus Saturday & Sunday saw even better quality time while studying since Sadie decided to compensate all losses accumulated during working periods over last three consecutive school night shifts earlier this month!
