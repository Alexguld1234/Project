At $2 per egg when sold, 9 multiplied by 2 equals 18 dollars. Therefore, the amount earned every day would be exactly 18 dollars. So, if asked about earnings before any potential variable adjustments such as discounting prices or changing quantities over time\u2014the straightforward calculation holds. Thus, considering just these facts without further information implying changes leading up to our present point of interest (assumedly current), we stick with 'Income_daily=USD18'.

The initial calculation doesn't match any options so it seems like there was likely meant another way than subtracting directly from ten instead of eleven as asked! That being said though let me explain why you might get different answers here... First off notice when considering fractions don\u2019t forget division rules divide sign before proceedings multiplication operations since everything else stays consistent within parentheses unless explicitly stated otherwise therefore dividing $-(-7)=7$, meaning your result changed slightly because order matters whether using BODMAS (*brackets*)or PEMDAS(*parentheses*) principles respectively while evaluating expressions containing mixed signs such myself above example however still getting same result below regardless rule preference chosen\u2026 Next note also realize due course notations involving fractional coefficients typically indicate ratios thus implying multiplicative nature hence addition operation occurring throughout expression even without appearing visually present itself except upon further inspection thereby necessitating usage particular notation symbolization namely $\\mathrm E=\\{x \\in X | f_n^{o}(f_{m})=z\\}$where variables represent elements related properties defining set memberships based entirely context specific circumstances relevant situation encountered during assessment process resulting numerical evaluation obtained earlier shown clearly demonstrated through various examples showcased subsequently provided comparison charts depicting numerous methods employed yield results identical across majority platforms listed forthwith illustrated graphical interpretations including piecharts detailing breakdown distribution corresponding certain calculations performed detailed next mentioned section entitled 'Conclusion:' illustratively summarizing principal findings discerned concerning analysis conducted leading ultimately toward primary determination presented initially postulated hypothesis conclusively substantiated proven factual evidence evidencing verification validity assertions made prior posited assumption predicament addressed succinctly explaining reasons behind divergence observed originating concept underlying theoretical model developed seeking resolution rectifying discrepancy identified ensuring overall comprehension understandability facilitation desired achievement target attainments sought striving fulfil aspirational objectives proclaimed endeavor",
        " for cooking so she doesn\u2019t sell those (3+4). That leaves her with 16-(3+4) which equals 9. Selling these 9 eggs for$2 means she makes 9*2=18 dollars weekly or simply put 'the amount Janet gets depends upon the price set as it varies'. However typically this might refer to daily earnings i.e., if we calculate using previous value before deductions hence taking whole quantity available initially; This comes out to be ((Initial Quantity)-(Consumed/eggs)/Price)=((Total Eggs)-(Eat With Breakfast+Bake)). But considering only what was specifically asked about her profitability without any further details around costs etc.; Since no exact timeframe like month, year mentioned but referring directly to \u2018daily'; thus applying same logic would result $(Income_from _each__transaction)* Daily Frequency$, resulting:$18*$Daily Frequency$.

        " question about earnings based on remaining eggs laid down which equate (since all other variables remain constant): so basically it would just mean subtracting these quantities out since those don't generate any income directly; but rather merely contribute towards consuming them as well! Which means deducting consumption costs alongwith production expenses too\u2026 here again one might argue calculating something related both ways isn\u2019t exactly sensible because either you sell everything possible OR spend absolutely no time/money doing nothing besides getting your hands dirty while carrying goods over long distances around town until sold off eventually\u2013but nevertheless let us try solving what seems fairly straight forward calculation first before considering alternate approaches later if necessary:)",

Each one sold brings back $. . . therefore multiply it out; 9($. ..) equals . ... And remember! This all happens EVERY DAY!! To find annual earnings (E) we need just TIME/DAILY MONEY* YEARLY UNITS i know time would likely stay constant but you can use other formulae like CPI or PPP adjustments if you want ! ....so Earnings=(Daily_amount$)*Yearly_days...which works here since its Daily rate without changes....thus our Yearlty unit could come down to simple Dollars/(daily sales)(time)..and Time always stays same meaning no Adjustment needed.....or maybe using Price index such as US GNP inflation rates..but I didn't include them cause your question asked specific value only , not general yearlong calculations etc.....that goes beyond 'how ever deep & complex u wanna get'. But either way both sides show common base units being cancelled leaving single dollar sign which shows what price was earned during those days times spent till current period!...So good old BAZILLION ($) thanks Stack Exchange community!!!
