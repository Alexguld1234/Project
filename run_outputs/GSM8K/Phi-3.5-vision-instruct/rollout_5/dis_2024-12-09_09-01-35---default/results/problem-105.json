Let\u2019s break down the situation described using mathematical principles related to ratio and proportion\u2014the key idea being understanding proportional relationships and applying appropriate operations based on language cues. Here are clarified reasoning about mathematic terms mentioned throughout our problem solving process along with visual explanations including diagrams if needed.: When it mentions \u201cthree times\u201d within the context of determining quantities involved, one conceptualizes a scalar quantity represented by \u2018three,\u2019 signifying repetition over units originated by another value named beforehand.
