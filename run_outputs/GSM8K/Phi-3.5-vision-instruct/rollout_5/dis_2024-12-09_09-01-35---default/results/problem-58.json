Finally don\u2019t forget those pesky little extras ($3+$4=$7). Adding these all together results into 50+(50*1/4)+(50*1/2)= $77 as your last grand statement..or so everyone wants me told... I say wait until getting audited ;-) Anyways hope everything makes sense because sometimes things seem easier when talking about them but get tricky during math class :) Let us know if anything still looks confusing ;) Have fun!!!\ud83d\ude04",

This conversion helps us see better why 2x moved figures worked just fine instead if trying regular methods above!
