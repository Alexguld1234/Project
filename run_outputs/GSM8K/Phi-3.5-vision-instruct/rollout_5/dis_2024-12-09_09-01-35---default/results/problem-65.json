Therefore over four weeks, the amount spent is just doubled since one month consists of approximately 4 weeks; hence we multiply the biweekly schedule result by 4 which results into  9(hours/biweek) x 4[weeks] resulting onto 36 hours altogether [over 4 Weeks]. That\u2019s not including breakfast or dinner time here because those activities could vary daily depending on personal habits like when people eat during their breaks etc., but considering only what was asked about Jim specifically related solely focused around relaxing practices such as viewing media content versus culinary pursuits \u2013 thus ignoring any potential differences brought upon due primarily towards routine tasks associated directly tied alongside dietary choices involved within typical contextual scenarios relating mainly toward fundamental sustenance needs aside purely social interaction based aspects commonly observed through regular community interactions common amongst human populations generally engaging themselves whilst consuming various forms foodstuff items ranging across both localities along broad geographical scales potentially intertwined together via global networks connecting disparate locations worldwide simultaneously thereby creating diverse connections linking individuals globally regardless however occasionally these links form unique pathways leading somewhere else entirely elsewhere often referred collectively under terms referring conceptually speaking regarding travel directions rather than literal physical routes followed exactly following predetermined paths precisely dictated otherwise intended specific methods defined explicitly beyond general vague approaches adopted informal settings typically reserved mostly behind closed doors shared spaces restricted areas prohibiting public access particularly limited mobility zones designed specially allocated sectors dedicated strictly enforced rules preventing unauthorized persons accessing designated boundaries marked clearly delineated lines demarcating separate regions exclusively devoted individual property belonging private enterprises state agencies federation governments international organizations nonprofit corporations religious denominational groups military institutions educational facilities hospitals medical clinics dispensaries pharmacies medicinal outlets retail stores small business establishments home offices family members relatives friends acquaintances companions fellow citizens strangers neighbors foreign tourists visitor national residents expatriates immigrants guest aliens temporary guests permanent reside nomads roving wanderers drifters aimlessly adrift sailboats anchored vessels moorings secure marinas harbors piers jetties ports whar",

As such , if we say Bob allocates twice whatever duration he dedicates to reading towards television viewing considering he settles down immediately post 'reading', which implies the split remains even despite him switching back afterwards within said period ; hence : [Bob(Reading)/TV] equals  2/(Total Time Spent). This yields a proportional representation of distribution rather than absolute figures since no specific quantities cancellingly dictate definitive division here but hint toward equivalence regardless due to immediate transition sans breakage/interruption mentioned prior.
