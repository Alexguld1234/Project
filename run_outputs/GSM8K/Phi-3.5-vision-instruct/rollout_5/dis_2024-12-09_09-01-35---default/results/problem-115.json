Half of the initial cost (for both types) would be as follows; ($10 / 2 ) = $5 and ($16 / 2)=$8 extra per unit board respectively. To get the current purchase price when adding those increases together comes out as ($15 + $8). Therefore($15+$8)$=$23 per unit board. Now calculating the sale profits becomes easy because having already established what amounts paid upon purchasing initially versus currently means revenue minus expenditure or 'profit'. Multiplying units sold times individual pricing yields revenues thusly (the quantity multiplied against its corresponding value): Ten 2x4*10 Boards= (ten)*(current-$10)+ (ten)*($5)= $(20+50)$. Furthermore,(Five)(Current \u2013 Old Price)= [(five)*(-3)] . We subtracting instead since increase occurred making our negative numbers which equals (-$15), therefore,-$(15)-[(20) -(50))]$=$(35)). This results into positive earnings indicating good business performance during inflationary time frames causing loss mitigations strategies such asset liquidity management being exemplified here through wood panel stock sales.(",
        " When Sasha sold these, their new price increased by 50%. Therefore, the sale price for the 2x4s becomes ($10*1.5)=$15 per board. And the sale price for the 4x4s become [($16)*(1+0.5)]=[$16*$1.5]= $24 each (because quantity times percent equals amount). Thus the revenue/profit gained form 2\u00d74 cancellasl as being [(quantity*original cost)-(quantity*current sales] which translates into $(10-$15) \u00d7 10=[-$50]. From here we take this negative value representing loss due to declining asset values over time. Similarly profits made off of larger dimension materials equates to $[24-(16*1.5)]*(5)$=$[24\u2212$24]*5=(0)(5)=0$. Overall earnings calculated using summation yields $-50+(0)=$-50 or indeed just lessons showing no gain overall even though individual items may appear 'profitable'. Because losses occur concurrently with gains without balancing out hence leading business owners like our subject experiencing financial strain while attempting entrepreneurship ventures despite seeming monetary successes among different product lines; thus highlighting importance considering opportunity costs when planning future investments strategies under market fluctuations circumstances especially involving primary goods whose resale potential might suffer depreciation versus capital intensive options possess higher returns stability etcetera but require additional startup resource infusion requiring careful risk assessment considerations prior undertaking such activities .
