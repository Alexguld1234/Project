Since the reach of the dragon's flame doesn't extend beyond this point (its maximum being around 1000ft), any location less than or equal to these 1200 ft would allow Polly to hit the dragon with the golden Javelin but standing exactly above Mount Farbo wouldn't ensure getting past all possible movement angles so we take just slightly below 1200 foot mark i.e., about 1199 feets approx) as safe position for throwing the javelin under optimal conditions against unpredictable movements of Perg.

This means Polly just barely misses striking Flamebreather while also throwing Javiel longer but falls back underneath guardian Dragonflame because our friend needs precision time alignment & energy management skills above all else -- plus enough skillfulness along side them too.. Here comes another round before next battle starts!! Let me summarize quickly what was mentioned here briefly\u2026 We talked about something called \u2018range\u2018 meaning ranges used mainly around physical movement problems/obstacles such like hitting target areas etc.; moreover these ranged effects happen using certain techniques applied especially during combat situations against opponents who possess special abilities similar those found inside medieval legends tales thus making life interesting yet dangerous simultaneously depending overall circumstances present both physically emotionnaly mentally health wise...

When holders such precious item this happens :range increases beyond normal boundaries like doubled speed ,triple effect etc .. .we take example here ;javelins reaches extra mile (double) while having Sapphires but because ranges starts decreases below zero point ie back starting position also called origin therefore once reaching maximum i..e triple increase means twice over hundred score(one less one thousand ) hence making overall throwing power around eleven plus tens places thus bringing us down towards minus side equalizing distances both ways outward & inside circle rounding negative figure off till nearest integer value resulting whole numbers keeping track safely avoid crossing danger zone leaving itself open againfor defense purpose assuming negligible effects due minor variations caused during action process ensuring proper security measures undertaken maintain stability equilibrium preserving structural integrity prevent undesirable consequences occurring amidst tumultuous conflict engaging hostile entities disruptively influencing environment uncontrollably thereby altering natural balance disturbingly transforming otherwise peaceful setting drastically worsening conditions leading dire situation requiring immediate intervention stopping potential havoc wrought through destructive forces potentially inflicting substantial damages irreversibly obliterate everything causing lasting impact irrevocable harm permanently devastating locale generating severe detrimental repercussions perpetually affecting surrounding region hampering further development opportunities hindering progress adversely stifling growth prospects impeding prosperity compromising livelihood resources deprivation eroding quality standards degrading human lives plunging people deeply into suffering distress despair anxiety grief loss hopelessness desolation torment pain afflict sufferings crises rendering population vulnerable helpless unable cope effectively resolving conflicts amicably building rapport amongst all parties facilitating productive dialogue promoting mutual understanding fostering collaboration working together finding common ground creating unity achieving consensus establishing harmony nurturing respect sharing generosity cultivating friendship encouraging trust inspiring confidence reinforcing faith strengthening bonds solidifying relationship deepening connections bond developing camaraderie forming alliance enhancing fellowship fortifying kinship empowering collectivity advancing community betterment championing cause galvanizing support rallying advocacy mobilizing",

It all depends what maximum limit you set while approaching such fantastical scenario about 'catching', attacking/hunting dead animals(these guys usually don't die). Thus setting your parameters before coming across complex situations always helps avoid trouble! One might say stay away completely depending also again due respect towards nature since real world scenarios often demand same caution too even though different circumstances exist everywhere around us every single moment (like weather conditions) resulting into potential risk factors occurring unexpected yet plausible possibility causing harm rather unintentionally sometimes leading accidents especially amongst children playing carelessly near unknown danger zones because small details matter greatly concerning their overall health protection throughout life years ahead...

Consequently, being able to strike further away makes hitting right underneath Perg no riskier since one might consider positioning directly adjacent or slightly outward instead of closer perilously towards him!

This means Polly stands safely exactly \\( \\text{safe distance}=\\text{(DragonsRange)}-\\text{(DistanceThrownWithGem Stone)}\\), which calculates into \\( \\text{1000} -\\text{(1200-1000)},\\) leading us to our conclusion that Safe Distance equals zero (\\(0\\)) because even though she hits past Dragons Range yet remains inside without falling victim",
        " since it reaches out that far plus what the stone allows her to cover beyond its range (so exactly 1000 ft). Therefore, without being too close or getting into danger zone closer than this limit, considering also the increased power thanks to the gemstones which makes the effective jump as per safe distances twice the allowed minimum required, namely , let 'x' represent Polly standing position relative to target location thus :  "
