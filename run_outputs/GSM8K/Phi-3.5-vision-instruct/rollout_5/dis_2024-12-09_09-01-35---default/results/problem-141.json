Lastly, since every single one out of these three types exist simultaneously inside the hive only once (as stated), their sum equals the original count i.e., Q+W+B = 700; substituting our variable relationships into this equation would result into following expression : Q+(2*Q)+(2*(2*Q)) = 700 --> simplify ==>  7Q = 700 \u2192 find value q using simple division technique => divide both sides by seven -> thus obtaining , Q = 100 ; substitute back in known values corresponding equations leading us to get respective amounts=> By replacing queue ('q') quantity within 'baby_to_queen', getting Baby Bees('b'): b=(y) .
