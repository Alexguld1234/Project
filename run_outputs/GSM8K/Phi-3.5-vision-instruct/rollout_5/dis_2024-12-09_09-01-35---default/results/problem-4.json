During the afternoon, we're told she provides twice as many cups than during breakfast \u2013 so again half the daily intake but across different portions which means another 15 cups provided here too. This leaves us with no remaining amount since both these amounts add up perfectly to meet the regular consumption rate when multiplied back by the same factor(number of hens). Therefore, based off current information available, we can conclude she doesn't require any further supplementation outside initial distribution unless other factors come into play like weather change or sudden illness/health issue among birds causing higher demand thereby increasing caloric requirements unbeknownst till date!

Considering these constraints stated above let us take both those values first, additions made up together make half a day care so when calculated properly like following manner \u2013 [Morning]+[Afternoon]=total_half_a_day ;or equivalently; full_days can include only half its part twice , hence doubling value found herein would result into whole extra unit needed .

We already know those numbers up here without doing further math because averaging works only over equal intervals\u2014and not within itself! No matter what time period you choose these quantities measured together can remain unchanged unless both sets vary independently too quickly relative across such short span before mixing again later than needed otherwise just repeat previous calculations but divide everything instead once while also making sure nothing else goes wrong along with whatever happened last minute during processing.. When looking closely enough though maybe even better suited option would involve division rather addition using fractions which explains why its used widely despite seeming complicated most especially due simplifying nature helping avoid tedious operations involved mostly being carried out directly afterwards hence getting less messily resulting outcome eventually regardless whether rounding method ultimately chosen applies still leading generally towards consistent results usually seen among various similar situations whenever comparing ratios etcetera anyway :) Oh dear boy who knew your explanation sound almost gibberish sometimes cause mine wasn\u2019t clear either :P Cheers!!",
