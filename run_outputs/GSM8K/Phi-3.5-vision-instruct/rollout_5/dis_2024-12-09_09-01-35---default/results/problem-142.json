Determine the amount Jordan spends gaming each day which equates to work time\u2014that\u2019s exactly what we want as it tells us his potential income when playing video games. Since Jordan spends 2 hours/day doing this activity over a week (there are seven days), multiply those together ($10*2$ per day) multiplied again by seven days. That totals up being $(10 \\times 2) \\times 7=$ <<10*2=20>>20\\times7=$<<20*7=140>>140 $. Hence Jordan can potentially make about $140 during that period otherwise known herein referred to as 'one week'.

Therefore, we get $(10)(8), or $80 earned during a typical Monday-Friday school/work schedule assuming no other factors interfere like vacations etc..

It sounds crazy right ?
