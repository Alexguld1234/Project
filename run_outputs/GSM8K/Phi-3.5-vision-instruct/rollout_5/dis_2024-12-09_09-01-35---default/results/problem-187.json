Therefore, Mandy needs to calculate using this formula; Principal or initial loan balance ($100) plus accumulated interests over three months [(Principal Amount)*(Interest Rate/100)]*Number Of Period). Using these values we get following result ((($100) *(.02)) * [((($100)+ (($100*.02)))+   )]); hence ; ",

Thus, adding the original debt amount ($100), we get $100+$6= $106 in total including interest over time. Therefore, if Mandy can afford both principal and accumulated interest, she needs to repay $106. That said, assuming no additional changes or terms about when halfway through their deal any adjustments occur such compound interest being taken into account remains unknown without further information.

        " month. Over three months, this totals up to  3 * 2 =$6 worth of debt accrued due to interest alone. Therefore, if all goes according to plan ,and assuming no repayments towards principal amount during these months except one payment made off the accumulated interests;the outstanding balance over period can still remain unaltered unless any further agreements like restructuring plans etc., come into picture.. so technically speaking without such considerations & merely considering 'interest collection only',mandy would hence need todeliver exactly double than what she borrowed initiallyto clear things upto zero(i.e.$100 initial loan).hence doublingthis figure we get::($100*2)=$200 . However,since actual situation may involve additional conditions not explicitly provided here nor accounting solely based upon those stated thus my previous explanation needs reconsideration under different scenarios accordingly ..
