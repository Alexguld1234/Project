What makes things slightly complicated however arises when factoring such unstated aspects alongside actual purchase prices while trying calculating totals thereby leading one down multiple tangential paths towards wrong conclusions especially if taken outright without carefully inspecting every element involved thoroughly first prior attempting closure statements regarding spending figures associated directly tied back onto original base values initially identified earlier throughout discourse hence requiring further analysis attention focus aimed accurately directed correctly pinpoint precise numerical result desired ultimately derived solely through calculated calculations precision based logical deductions supported primarily heavily upon presented factual data contained strictly exclusively pertaining core topic matter specifically highlighted early amid narrative formulation phase ensuring consistent reliability across entirety dialogue continuum inclusive surrounding context related circumstances implicated subsequently during latter stages execution processes integral crucial understanding necessitated imperatively sustaining said coherence essential undergirding groundwork foundational necessity entails satisfying requisite information clarity paramount significance uphold achieving goal outcome intended sought accomplishment expected deliverable promised achieved precisely target value reached exactly quantifying exactitude demanded meticulousness warranted rigor mandatory accuracy vital indispensable key instrumentality employed critical importance pivotal role performance responsibility undertaken assumed delegated assigned entrusted committed obligation honored fulfilled contract adhered closely observed terms respectful accord concurred maintained consensus arrived mutually agreed settled negotiated compromise concluded decisively resolved satisfactorily accomplished comprehensive success attained fully complete finish job completed perfectly perfect work well craftsmanship satisfied expert quality impress impressed professionalism skillfully executed finely tuned operation flawlessly function smoothly",

Therefore, before including insurance pricing as asked separately later, the initial payment made was just the combined cost of the materials and craftsmanship services i.e., $500 + $800 = $1300; no percentage calculations applied yet until specified otherwise.
