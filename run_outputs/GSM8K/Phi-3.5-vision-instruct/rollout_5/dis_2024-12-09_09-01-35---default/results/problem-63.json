This means she only spends $(\\frac{9}{10})\\times$ as much as before; hence she still costs $$(\\frac{9}{10}\\cdot840)=$$$756$. Therefore Alexa spent a total of $$(840+756)=$$$1596.   ",
        " figure out what Aleena was being billed after receiving their discount\u2014this means finding 10% off of $140/month (the standard rate): .10 * ($140) = $14 reduction; because it\u2019s taken off her bill every subsequent six months starting June (at which point another reduced price cycle begins), therefore reducing the original charge over those time periods slightly until December \u2013 when you add up all three payments due within this period together equals your new sum). Since February through May still uses regular rates & November also includes one extra payment made before January arrives next year (!!!!) these \u201cadditional\u201d costs mean nothing towards determining exactly whether any overall savings accumulated happened during either scenario nor if even such calculations could accurately measure precisely enough changes happening sequentially across multiple specific dates without accounting equally both negative increases AND positive decreases simultaneously\u2026but rather only looking backward toward understanding historical pricing structures instead providing accurate assessment tools regarding future expectations going forward based solely upon present knowledge concerning available data sources known hereinabove referenced throughout passage contents..

Next, moving onto calculating the charge during the second part of the year; because the pricing fell 10%, let\u2019s discover what ten percent out of $140 amounts to: Decrease= ($140)x(1/10)=$14 Thus when you subtract those saved expenditures from your standard bill: Altered Monthly Amount=(OriginalMonthlyAmount)-Decrease=$140-$14=$126 Consequently over the remaining stretch \u2014 another three phases comprising the next semester \u2013 totalling twelve cycles times the altered daily subscription value results as follows: TotalSecondHalfOfYearCost=[(Altered Monthly Value)*RemainingDuration]=[$126]*[3*6] Substitution brings us back down around [$126]*[18]. As such Multiplication returns our desired numerical solution:[($126)*[(18)]], finally presenting approximately $2268.

        " the cost decreased by 10%. Therefore, this means their billing rate became (10/100)*$140= $14 cheaper every month during the last six months compared to what Aleena normally pays ($14). This implies new subscription price equals old fee minus discount i.e., $140-$14=$126 per month for those next six months or another one third part of full year chargeable period; hence sixth term amounts up to (6*126)=$756 . Consequently , when you add these together \u2014i.e., original dues plus reduced fees-, your accumulated expenditure throughout whole twelve months turns out equaling $840+$756= $<<840+756=1596>>1,596..
