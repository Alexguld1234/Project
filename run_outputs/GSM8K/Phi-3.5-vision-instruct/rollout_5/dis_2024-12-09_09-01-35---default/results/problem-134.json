Therefore we divide those sixty months over seventeen other non-winter seasons which yields around three whole months spent buying car care products every nineteen summers; consequently dividing these amounts into fourth (divided equally) parts results such tom would spend ten minutes getting ready instead before entering stores like Costco or Sam's Club looking only through their prices carefully whilst also taking advantage of sales whenever possible!

Therefore calculating average values based upon those results yields higher estimation rates than using simple multiplication alone since any additional factors may vary greatly within periods smaller intervals compared beforehand !
