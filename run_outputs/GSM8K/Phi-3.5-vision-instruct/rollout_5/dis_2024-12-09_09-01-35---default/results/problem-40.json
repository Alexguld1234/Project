        " times as old as Ben's. Therefore, it would be 4 * 2 = 8 years old. The answer is: 8.",
        " this case, we know the relative ages of three phones using simple multiplication principles; if one phone (Ben) is twice another phone's age (Suzy), multiply Suzy's age by two \u2013 which equals 2 years (since Suzy is 1). To find out about Brandon's device, take these calculated figures and determine their multiplicative relationship once again; since it states that Benjamin's mobile phone was 'four times' instead of simply double Ben's cellular gadget versus Suzy's smartphone, therefore quadruple our previously identified figure\u2013which equates to 2 \u2014 results into eight units per unit time period being sixteen years. Thus, Brandon owned what could technically best classified amongst contemporary Apple Inc technology devices under its lineage \u2018iPhone SE', but only hypothetically speaking considering possible variations in iOS versions during those particular tenure points over successive decades spanning across approximately twenty periods following such mathematical computations concerning chronological intervals passed among specified individual items bearing resemblance through brand names shared within industry market strategies while concurrently adopting certain design characteristics inherent throughout several models released subsequently post said initial unanimous introduction date occurrences markings respective historical data collection records reflectively corresponding events coinciding synchronously alongside other related significant milestones contributing towards collectively establishing specific quantifiable values linked directly correlated backward implications tracing allotted sequential associations leading definitive conclusions deriving overall impactful understanding resulting finally enabling us present comprehensible summary interpretations henceforth summarily stating conclusion supported solely based upon analytic evaluations processed systematically methodically utilizing deductive reasoning applicable accordingly thus thereby allowing proper placement contextually appropriate descriptions fitting suitably precise circumstances fulfillment requirements precisely adhering strictly no additional assumptions beyond explicitly stated parameters provided above including any references made elsewhere perhaps indirectly relatable though not specifically mentioned nor inferred otherwise anywhere else regardless however generally agreed consensus holds strong true universally recognised globally accepted scientific concepts namely Newtonian mechanics governing laws gravitational constant force applied even when manipulated subject matter involves human interaction affectivity levels influencing behavioural responses triggered reactions initiated stimulus prompt reaction cascading effect ripple chain perpetuation dynamics alter cyclic repetitive patterns manifest observable tangible effects evidenced measurable differences yield distinct discernable comparisons facilitating thorough analysis providing deeper insights regarding underlying relationships established pre",
        " any direct age information about Brandon's phone but instead told it relates indirectly through those who own other iPhones (Suzy & Ben). We also know Ben's phone is twice the age of Suzy's which means since Suzy's phone is only one year old; therefore ,Ben owes six years based upon these relationships thus making him double of suzy . Finally using the rule mentioned earlier regarding brandon ' s iphone being quadrupled compared to ben \u2019 s implies when multiplied upward towards twentyfour months because if anyone was supposed to say eightmonthsoldforbriansiphonethenbrandonsonewouldbeayearolderbecausewearerulingoutthereachunderstandingfromthepuzzlementwhichiscauseofamisshintnthatthisquestionwastryingtoimplyinitscoreqeury) As such even though our math equation might seem off its intent still points out toward correct solution(ie.,if your question demanded usstofindyourageswithrespecttotothateyousaidsohereseemscorrectalthoughcalculationsmightneedrevisitingbutsinceanswercanbeguessedwithoutanyformulasjustaslongastopperfectanewtwentysixthtime),concluding conclusion :",

It seems reasonable that younger siblings may exhibit similar behaviors due to shared experiences during their formative years (before puberty).
