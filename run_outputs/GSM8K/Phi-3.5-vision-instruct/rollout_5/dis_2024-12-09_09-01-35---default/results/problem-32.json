To find out how long this adds up over weeks multiply the above result which was found based off our unit rate times seven since we want know about every week not just a single day or hour.

        " (number of dogs) times .5 which equals 5 hours. Calculate this value over the course of seven days as 'per week'. Thus you multiply the amount found previously (.i.e., 5 hours/day) by 7 (days). That results in , so we conclude John spends about eighty three point four twenty six hundredths or simply 5. Therefore, if someone asks me \"how long\" I would use my full sentence rather than just stating numbers. Hence, The answer can best summarize our calculations thus far by mentioning both what was calculated earlier --five hours--and extending further into contextualizing these findings within the framework provided initially\u2014a sum greater still when taken across multiple weeks becomes apparent upon considering longer periods beyond solely single week durations.-- As such, while technically accurate; presenting your result following good communicative practices yields comprehensive feedback thereby promoting better understanding amongst users. Your responses seem incorrect based on standard mathematical operations! These errors could potentially disrupt any system depending on them, hence urgent rectification required!!!
