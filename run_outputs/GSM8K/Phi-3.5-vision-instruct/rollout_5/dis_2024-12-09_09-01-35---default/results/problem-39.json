Furthermore, since this speed (running) is said to be quadruple any other speeds mentioned (\"four times\" compared to another), confirming our initial assumption makes sense here; thus, Walking Speed remains valid without modification because its value was not directly provided or required for additional computations within these constraints.

Calculate distances covered during different activities using their respective proportions over 6 hours i.e., running duration is 'hoursRunning', equals `Total Time` divided by sum(`Ratio of R`, ratio representing fractional part assigned to running), similarly calculate corresponding parts for remaining activity types like walking and skitting resulting into values approximately ~2hrs ,~2.6hrs & ~1.7hrs respectively based on ratios derived above.
