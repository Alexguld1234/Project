Therefore if three such numbers represent winners\u2019 portion it translates to roughly 60% which corresponds exactly to what the problem states `(because winning candidate accounts for approximately 75%).` To discover your loss percentage, subtract voting totals correspondingly thus getting around 25%, meaning all non\u2013winner shares form only 1 third according to calculation above .
