        " on vacations (34 - 23) which equals 11 times. Since every vacation trip yields exactly 1 new quilt block due to using only those specific items as fabric material; we can multiply this figure by the number of annual trips per timeframe or events held annually during all these occurrences thus yielding us(NumberOfTripsPerYear* TotalNoOfEvents). From the problem statement, it states, 'He goes on four vacations a year.' Hence, Numberoftripsperyear=4 . Furthermore ,it also says, ''Each row consists of unique instances collected over varying periods\". This implies that no repetition occurs across rows but rather each distinctly represents a separate occurrence hence suggesting equal amounts within respective columns namely : First Year Trips Column/Second Year Trips column etc... up till our last instance i.e.,eleventh year represented along y axis so forth being equivalent when taken collectively.
