Lastly if three people didn\u2019t purchase anything then no discount applies either here because nobody purchased less than planned i.e.; not even free items; just zero expenditure/transactions made towards new goods hence keeping original figures intact .

Okay, I see what went wrong before--my mistake lies within simply summing everything without properly tracking individual transactions through distinct categories or sequences(i.e., cumulative rather than discrete).
