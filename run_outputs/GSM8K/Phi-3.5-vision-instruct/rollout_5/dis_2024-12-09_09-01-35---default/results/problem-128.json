        " watermelon (or 3P - 5), ten oranges thus equal $(3P - 5) * 10$. To find the prices needed, consider solving it like this way: Assume P=15$: Hence: Watermelons = \\$45$ ($15 \\times 3$). Peppers = \\$30$ ($15 \\times 2$) Orange cost per fruit = \\$10$ ($15-$5). Total cash spent buying Oranges equals $$100$$ ($30+$45+\\$10\\$, which multiplied over \\(10\\) fruits yields $$\\frac{C}{T}=F\\cdot N$$ henceforth answering Firm X purchases Item Z while paying Price Y based off Equation TX(W/Z)=FX+NY; considering additional factors such as promotional deals represented through subtraction of set amounts (Dollars denoted hereininautonomous systems commonly employed within various commercial institutions.)",
