        " First calculate Beatrice's since it contains only one type size (the width): Beatrice\u2019s packaging volume is 2x24=48 square units because we consider every rectangle section represents one 'unrolled', no matter its shape or form. Similarly, calculating Marcell's voluimece yields: His \u2018packet\u2019 equals 3 times 14 which results in 42 unit volumes; again being any individual part representing one consumed fruity treat \u2013 whether small, rectangular strips or other geometric shapes entirely randomized together may not even appear like traditional geometry yet still adhere strictly mathematically when considering parts whole rather than actual sizes per se.)

It seems like this question might involve making assumptions about what constitutes an \"average\" based purely geometrically/mathematically without regard to specific contextual information such things called surface areas don\u2019t necessarily translate directly into edible portions especially involving variable sized food items!

Similarly, M\u00e1rcola used three width strips making sixteen columns which results in 14x6= 84 individual fruits rolled ups i.e., bertram_total= 84 items. Total consumption combined equals sum(bertta+marcela)= beretta*number_of_rows + marcela; meanwhile averaging over N variables means dividing all by 'N': let \u2018mean\u2019 denote our desired result herein ((bertta*(berryatas)+marcela)/N). Substituting values we get [(48n/N)+84]/N=(48n+84N)/NI apologize for any confusion.

        " Beatrice's pack, we multiply width times length: 2 x 24=<<2*24=48>>48 rolls. Similarly, for Marcell\u2019s batch it would be 3x14 which equals <<3*14=42>>42 rolls. Together this sums up to (48+42)=<<48+42=90>>90. They ate all together; thus if you divide them equally amongst themselves since only one quantity remains regardless whether people take turns or not. Hence averaging over those packages means every person gets half share i.e.(90/2)and therefore per package takes away ((90/2)/(48+(3*14))).This yields::((90 / 2 )/( 48 + (3*14)))i.e., approximately ::6 . Therefore ,if marce ll n takethis value into account upto four decimal places ;so rounded off results becomes :   ",

We also know that this particular packing error made hers two extra rows than normal; however those spaces don\u2019t represent any actual product because it wasn\u2019t stacked correctly according to plan. This means if you take away these empty \u201cseats\u201d or missing slots caused due carelessness during production time \u2013 only half( i.e., ~24 pcs ) come into play when comparing against standard orders . And considering no overlap occurred since everyone kept consuming without sharing , thus adding all fruity cylindrical treats together amounts yield roughly identical quantities compared versus what either party consumed independently despite different dimensions owning individual bags/pouches :",
        " 2 roll-ups (width) = 48 individual rolls. Similarly, for Marcell's stash, it would also yield 3 wrap units (each unit being one side length divided by width; i.e.,  14/3). Multiplying these dimensions together yields approximately 4.67 complete wraps or about 5 packaged sets assuming no breakage occurs during wrapping due to partiality since fruits don\u2019t get cut when rolling them into packages which might leave us off slightly but better than before without this assumption if broken down further. However according to common practice regarding food service sizes including snack products such as candy bars along similar lines concerning standardized package form factors etc.; hence rounding numbers helps maintain uniform presentation standards even within smaller batch production contexts alike thus resulting essentially what follows herein following conventional industry expectations rather than purely theoretical calculations per se...

Their combined consumption equates to 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Marcell), equaling 90 roll-ups overall.
