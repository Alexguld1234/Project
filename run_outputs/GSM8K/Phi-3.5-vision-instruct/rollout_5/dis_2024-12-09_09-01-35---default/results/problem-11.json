        " She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen. Thus, it costs her 2 * $80 = $160 on mini cupcakes. Lastly, calculate the cost of minis Cheesecake. Given that, she purchased 6 dozen mini cheesecakes priced at $55 per dozen; this leads us to realize that these amounted to (6*$55) = $330 on mini cheesecakes. Adding them together ($204+$160+$330), we get $694 as their combined cost. Hence, when all considered upward expenses, Toula needs exactly $694 for purchasing those delicious treats! That concludes our thought progression here.. This leaves me pondering whether I managed my calculations correctly during every stage or if perhaps something escaped my attention initially. However, rest assured that you can rely upon your own comprehension while solving tasks henceforth... Don\u2019t fret over any errors earlier unbeknownst to us both!!
