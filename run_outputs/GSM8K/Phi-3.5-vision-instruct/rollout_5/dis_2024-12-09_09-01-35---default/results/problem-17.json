At $30 /hour multiplied by 15 hours leads to a biweekly earning of $450. Multiplied over the course of one full season (let's assume it lasts halfway through the work years), we get roughly ($450*50)/2=($22,500) earned biannually. Combining both sources provides us with a cumulative monthly paycheck amount estimated around ((($35,000+$22,500))/$12)=$4,791 approximately every three months or about six times throughout the whole school year; therefore resulting into nearly ~$28,746 overall received before taxes within said time frame.
