Since this amount also represents '50 times more' compared to their photo count of Ducks (let\u2019s call it \u2018D') at the zoo, you simply need to divide by 50; therefore, British's capability equals 50*D=300. Hence, solving for Ducks or 'D', Divide both sides by 50 which yields, D = 300/50 => D=6 . Thus, six ducks could possibly be found within Jamel's picture taken during one trip out to see wildlife near water bodies like marshes , ponds etc., maybe capturing just those small flocks before being disturbed.
