Since half the outcomes on any single die roll result in an even number, the chance is (1/2)*(1/2) which equals 1/4 or 25%. Subtract the second percentage (for the sequence of doubles) from the first percentage (rolling over three). Therefore, we find Jerry is about 66.67% - 25% =  41.67 % likelier to roll a number greater than 3 rather than getting two doublets successively when both dice are rolled consecutively without replacement. Hence, rounding off upwards due to potential variance; one could say roughly speaking within a certain degree of uncertainty 'likely.' ",

Henceforth, let us calculate all remaining possiblities i.e.,rolling odd numbers twice minus those possibilities involving exactly two identical faces:(all nonzero results)-odd singles-(even pairs)+odds quadruples+mixed trio+(evens quartet):$(3/6)^n$ [where n denotes face type]=$(\\frac{1}{2})^n$.In case event ",
