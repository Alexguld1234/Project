Hence our first logical estimate suggests 'around thirty six'. However note here term 'female professor' was used based on provided data relating gender split amongst population only which may differ when including other potential factors such educational qualifications etc.; yet considering basic logic behind initial problem set up leads towards said estimation thus rounding off closest feasible guess thereby maintaining conceptual accuracy without deviating further into assumptions henceforth considered acceptable during calculation phase unless additional precise instructions warranted otherwise i\\.e., absence any contradictory details regarding exact distribution nature alongside age group segmentations requiring refined consideration respectively ensuring minimal conjectural intrusion onto broader context surrounding query premises..
