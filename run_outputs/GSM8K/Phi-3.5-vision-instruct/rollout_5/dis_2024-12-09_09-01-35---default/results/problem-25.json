        " items before buying pizzas (chicken plus apple): Chicken ($12) + Apples (4 * $1.50 = $6). This equals $12 + $6 = $18. We subtract this amount from the total payment made to determine how much went toward purchasing pizzas alone. Therefore, $50 - $18 leaves us with $32 earmarked for pizzas. Finally, since each box of pizza costs $8.50, divide the remaining balance by the price per pizza to figure out quantity: $32 / $8.50/box = approximately 3.76, which means Marie could not buy partial boxes; thus rounding down, she purchased **3** whole boxes of pizza.
