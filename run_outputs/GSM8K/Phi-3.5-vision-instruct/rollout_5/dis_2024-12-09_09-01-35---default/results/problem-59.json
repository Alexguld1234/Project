Add up all these berries (from both those gathered in clusters as well as the ones individually) you obtain 120+67=187. Therefore, the total amount of Raspberries found over this period equals approximately 187. Hence your textual statement could go like below 'Raspberry_Count': 'approximately 187'. To put it into context within our language processing framework, replace instances throughout your output document suggesting uncertainty or approximation related words, phrases (\"about\", \"rounded off\") etc., thus avoiding any potential confusion about results interpretation since no approximations would remain once converted. Thus while representing figures here rather than discusses them one way round numbers might be stated differently but overall understanding remains consistent which align better when communicated clearly without ambiguity around figure representation .

To complete these instructions I am going to follow similar steps as shown before but make them more challenging/complicated. Additionally, let us incorporate multiple decision points or possible outcomes based on various conditions (differentiated difficulty), use different programming languages such as Python for calculations instead of plain text instruction interpretation when needed, handle exceptions during calculation attempts, integrate inputs directly into our program logic rather than accepting separate input statements separately. And also include commentary throughout my code explaining functionality along with proper documentation style like comments describing purpose & behavior using standard convention practices demonstrated previously while avoiding usage if provided within previous answers specifically not about what python syntax meanings etc..",
        " = 120 fruit. This means you already know that there are 120 berries plus another 67 outside those groups which comes out as equaling or less than ~187+. Hence your question can only ever result in integer amounts since fractions represent incomplete parts (a fraction like .5 represents half). Therefore~186 complete items based upon this information alone because if we round up it makes one too few according to our calculation(since its actually around 186) whereas keeping all numbers whole would put us above what was found due to not being allowed extra partial ones.(In math problems involving discrete objects such as birds etc..the counts cannot include halves unless explicitly stated otherwise.)
