Summarizing concisely brings our solution closer but still keeps necessary detail intact leading up to :\"$(33*$15+$((33*$15)*$15))=${UD}${$7,425}. That implies overall revenue generated through offering 33 instances of costumised activities amount stands UDS.$7,425.\" As specified initially I am not simplifying too far down into single or double digits numbers anymore therefore my primary approach maintains requisite clarity throughout entire calculation procedure without divestment even upon reaching sum stage leaving reader well aware & comprehensible about conclusion drawn directly aligning neatly within stipulated output parameters ending finally with 'Anwer is:' .
