Rephrasing helps convey actions directly tied logically to subjects involved\u2014such as door movement connected explicitly to people performing the action makes narrative flow smoother. Consider using active voice instead of passive constructs ('John walks') often enhances sentence readability compared with indirect expressions possibly linked to unrelated events such as 'leaving.'

        " 60 seconds but gets progressively faster \u2013 the next member finishes in (60-3) = 57 seconds, followed by another which runs it even quicker still finishing time as being (60+3)-3 = 57 secs. Their last guy also saves himself ~= (60-(2*3))\u20133 =  51 sec.(Remember that every person was slower.) Thus adding them up would look like such\u2026(First Runner)*n+(SecondRunner)(n-1)+...((LastRunner))...gives us: n*(a_1+an)/2=(sumofrunngtimesforteamtwo)=(~=. Therefore we get....n . That tells me ....., hence the difference b/w winning times! ",
        " B\u2019s improvement happens over three legs (for all four athletes), we divide those saved times up equally among them ((60 \u2013  55) / 3). This means .67*3 = almost exactly 2 additional seconds per athlete compared to their predecessors. Each member therefore runs in only : 60/((x^1)+(x^2)+(x^3)) sec.<|end_of_document|> To solve it like your example problem would require solving a cubic polynomial equation which can prove quite difficult as such problems usually get extremely complicated unless you find specific constraints simplifying things. However let me present you with simpler solution using linear equations since the situation here appears easier even though being presented under 'very hard difficulty':<|end_of_prompt|><br/> Considering both sportsman having same running speed i mean difference won\u2019t come due to different abilities rather because timings provided about each sportsmans performance while racing indicates differences so when time spent doing physical activities decreases welfare services costs related to injury treatment , recovery period and overall health decrease thereby creating significant savings too thus making exercise worth investment! Alright Sir please provide detailed explanation based upon above analysis alongwith numerical calculation showing clear steps involved..

        "), we need only consider when/if any member finishes ahead of Time1\u2019s complete time . With even improvement over several legs , however impossible it may seem here \u2013 since improvements can not cancel out initial delay -- Eventually eventually finally\u2026when(ish) all goes right everyone ends up taking advantageously similar times while still finishing before those who began slower without stopping progress making gains greater again compared too what was initially true about being behind someone else having better overall speed yet never allowing enough extra lead gained throughout prior laps equal later lagged down during latter events such situation arises quite naturally occurring thus proving why despite best attempts fail repeatedly ; henceforth known commonly simply as \u201dTeam Two\u201d.
