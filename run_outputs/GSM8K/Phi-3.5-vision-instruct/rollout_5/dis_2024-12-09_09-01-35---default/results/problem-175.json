        " the net income/profit every gallon is Revenue \u2013 Cost = $10 \u2013$5= $5. Juan & His Brother sold enough juice so that profits was equal as stated which means g*($5)=$25. We solve this equation knowing value ($5): g=$25/$5 => g=5 . This implies making 5 gallons because if we assume them buying ingredients just once , spending equally would mean dividing ammount spent among all those gallons produced ! Spendings : let P represent what our target variable here ....P=(number_of_ingridient_bags*amountspentperbag). Amount needed To produce one Gallon Is Same As Number Of Glass It Can Produce(In Our case That Would Be 20 ), Which Means $$Spends Per One BagOfLemonsAndOneBagOfSugers$$ Will Equal $(Number\\ Gal\u00d7GlassPerGall)/NumBatchAtOnce Or Simply Put \\frac{ReqBudget}{NetProfitableMoney}\u00f7(NeededVolume)\\timesTotalCostSo $$\\begin{align*} &\\text{(Amount Needed Per Batch)}=\\left(\\frac{\\$25}{\\$5}\\right)^{\\prime\\prime}\\\\\\\\&\\left(\\frac{$25}{$5}\\right)=\\frac{{cost}}{netmargins}\\\\& {cost}=total_{batch}=\\${10}\\\\,\\,\\,therefore \\\\&&={one\\_ingridintion}_{batch}&=\\frac{$10}{20glass\\\\[^{}_{}}}] =\\${\\hspace{6mm}$}0.5\\text{'}'\\\\\\end{align*}$$Which At Last Makes ",
        " gallons worth. This means Juan and Carson spent $5 per gallon times g gallons or $5x=cost of all the lemons and sugar. But we know this amount equals John\u2019s earning minus Pedro\u2019s contribution so we can calculate as follows: Cost of Lemons+Cost_of Suger=$Pedro Contribution+$John Earnings. We want only one variable hence subtracting both sides leads us to solve for G which turns out to be ($Gallons*$Lemon/gal)+($Gallons*Sugars)=$Profit-$Both brothers Earnings respectively substituting these yields : $((Number of Gallons)*Lemongrass)/galls+(((Number Of Galenods)* Sucrose )/gals)$=$(peterContriubution + JohnsEarning)-$(petersearning+johnsearning). Finally inserting values finally revealing Lemycon grass being used ,we find our solution . Here since peter contributes half of john's earning thus Peter contributions plus juan earnings equalling Peters earninng wich also represents profits givens below ; ((Total Profit)) -( Both Brothers Funcintions Total Value ). Thus replacing variables accordingly; Solving Equation brings us into determining price paid foor lemons via dividing caculate above resulting value by quantity used when combined results yield optimal financial equation producing necessary conclusion. That Is :- (25-(Petercontributedonehalf))$fruitscostperlb=(lbspricedeedplb*(totalFruitsUsed/(Totalfruittotalusedplusfriutesucceded)))Substitution And simplification produces desired result hereas calculated based offinputvaluesandoperationmethodologyaboveyielding",
        " on lemons would be 5 * $3 = $15. The answer is: 15.",
        " earns them $0.50 and they can fill 20 cups from one large container or jug; so divide $.50 into 20 portions ($0.50/20), which equals less than $.03 worth of product sold to obtain this income . That means when multiplied together ($,50/$0.03*20=.), yields about $,27x$ , not including additional containers required during intervals over time--which we didn't count here because no mention was placed upon those particular circumstances within context ; thus omitting further calculation requirements!
