Therefore, rounding off, about 12 hamsters are placed into one group i.e., in 10 places outlets. Since only integer quantities can exist here (as partial animals aren\u2019t possible) this problem appears not solvable as presented initially under classic Euclidean geometry assumptions but may make sense considering non conventional settings such as fractional creatures existing concurrently). Under strictly classical logic principles though, no solution exists hence rendering irrelevant further calculations regarding potential misplacement errors within said original question set framework since any attempt would introduce externalities beyond initial established bounds thereby resulting indirect contradictory repercussions upon foundational inquiry premises .
