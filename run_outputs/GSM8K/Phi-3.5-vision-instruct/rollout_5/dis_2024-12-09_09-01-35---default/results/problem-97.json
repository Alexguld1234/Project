Since Freda used thirty two pounds combined across all pots \u2013 which indicates ten containers worth--we multiply those quantities together getting twenty times ten equals hundred forty combinations possible. With these results calculated previously mentioned items such as only having accessibility enough product yield limited potential outputs therefore forcing restraint until reaching maximum capability before expansion occurs hence further limiting future growth opportunities .
