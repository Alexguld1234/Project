        " Scottish unicorns. Out of these Scotsmen, two thirds are females so we can find out the amount like this way; Total Unifrons * Fraction Of Females => Male And Female Equals Each other Since only half fraction represents males i need my numerator alone which means it would look something like NumberOfUnicornsfemales / Fracoffemales(which equals one). Because when I multiply fractions you always want your top numbers or our numerators equal as well therefore what makes up whole is male ones plus female make another whole however if its just single unit but doubled already no difference because whatever their ratio was before multiplying still stays the same afterwards even though multiplication happened not addition thus proving point above regarding why having both sides being multiples counts equally toward answering whether question asked here regards quantity regardless type used since formula itself contains inherent equivalence logic within mathematical system applied hence making any distinction impossible without breaking rules governing basic math operations themselves namely division & subtraction respectively according too laws dictated through Euclidean geometry principles set forth ages ago long predating modern era technological advancements capable changing everything forever including previously established truth claims held strongly believed ever sway powerful arguments presented often convincing skeptics using scientific methods despite factual evidence available contradictory belief systems claimed nevertheless persisted until finally disproved recently upon further scrutiny revealed fallacies underlying premise underpinned entire framework consisting main argument components albeit ultimately found faulty causing initial assumption wrong leading latter conclusion invalid thereby creating basis groundwork allowing logical reasoning process begin incorporate validity verification criteria during investigation phase ensuring sound judgment exercised throughout assessment procedure subsequently enabling objective analysis methodology utilized effectively determining most accurate resolution applicable scenario specific situation identified requiring clarified focus points addressed prior discussions relieved uncertainty concerns surrounding particular matter involved examined thoroughly following comprehensive review conducted alongside relevant individuals closely followed guidelines carefully applying critical thinking skills attained years previous studying subjects related topic sought explaining complex theories understanding implications resulting benefits gained form study pursued earlier mentioned subject course offering valuable insight useful towards resolving problems similar nature encountered while solving equations dealing trigonometric functions involving geometric figures constructed around concept introduced classroom lessons facilitated learning experience aimed providing learners ample opportunity developing necessary knowledge base required succeeding graduation level courses offered universities across country nationwide encouraging continued education growth aspiring individual seeking advanced degrees possess solid foundation built primarily building blocks needed complete masterpiece",
