We know that Katy uses tea spoons/cups based off this ratio which means every time you add one cup(cup), it would use seven times as much sugar since its part per hundred units isn\u2019t divided yet. Therefore if \u201cx\u201d represents Sugar while representing Water simply being multiplied by three beforehand, ((x+y*7)) / (((x+y)*7)+ y) equals 7 out of ten parts or seventy percent meaning our equation becomes\u2026..let us solve these equations simultaneously!

        " every time Katy uses this amount combination (both adding together), it adds 7 parts out of the total part count which would be 7 (from sugar) plus 13 (from water), equaling to 20 parts altogether. Therefore, if we assign 'x' as one unit within these totals\u2014wherein 7 units represent our measure of interest here i.e., the quantity of sugar; we get 7/20*120=  42 teaspoons.*(Note: Ensure you consider fractions or divisions when solving.)
