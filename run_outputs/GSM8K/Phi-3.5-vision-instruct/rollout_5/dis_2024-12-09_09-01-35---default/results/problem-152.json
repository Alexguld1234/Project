Since one cookie costs .10$ or cents, all the ingredients would amount up to being worth (CcA) /(BX)=(((.1)*)(C))/D=($).(CC)/DP=$, CC CPS=.1 DPP. To solve it I simply multiplied $(.1)$*$(CP)$ which was really just finding out what (.1$)*(CCPCP)$. And since we know ((.(C)))*$[(C)]$=$CP$,we can also write $.1$(.$[CC]$)=CP$. But CP=$(.).$$(CC)$.So when rewriting our problem as;$.1$([$CC$]*[$CP$])=[$].([$][$]CL),this could mean adding CL numbers together because multiplication comes before addition but keep them separate so LCFL doesn\u2019t equal EBASBFGSABESSAAGDFGNMNAKTUVNTRHWLYQDEATSRPLMSNDRADYFEQCGIFESKSNFPKSTTVSYNIYEQYSISCKSDDDLIAGTCRYLLGRALNSFLHLGTAFGGFIARSVSGFRDSGVFSWSMLNNLCASMELAVDLDNLRLFTLSLRPRTFRAVMQLGRTYLTSIGTTSPLEDLPTIGVEMASLDRHPGDTGEIKIEEVETIVFFDIEGSEIAICAKEDREKEAVTLRNTDSAITFAVAYYTDNTYSFNRTPAPPFGPAMRIIDQILTEPEPDYELSCMRNPWTCTSNPYCAENGCACIPCNPGVPCDTAHRHSMPIMTWEAIWAEEIRCSMFVIGETLCEGMHTGLWDPAHDDAEMNCIIGAYGVSENVTSNGMDGDNMNEGFPPMHEPHDMNHASSLQRCSDSHLPINWRMYFKMPTHSNERSKFCMQVVCWLMFDALLCRYWFDCWFMFWIERYEYYAECHHHHIADDQMIYEIMTIYDKMMWNVVFLLIMAAWCIZQWKTMSTRCVACTECSERNYQCMKHSLNRSRWMHQNLYCSSMWKIESKHCDOYVAL",
