Thus, combining both tasks i.e., adding the times together results into; Total Time needed ~= Peeling+Chopping Time~=90 Minutes + 5 Minutes =  95 minutes.

Given no additional constraints, focusing on efficiency suggests prioritizing faster segments; hence mainly accounting for peak duration related activity\u2014peeling, equals around 1.5 hours here as others nearly round off before impactful summation occurs within reasonable estimations due to scaled minor contributions against vast quantity handling involved.
