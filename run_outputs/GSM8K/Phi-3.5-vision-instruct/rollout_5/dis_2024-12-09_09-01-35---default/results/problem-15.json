To identify what amounts these percentages translate into you need first divide them through hundred (i.e., respectively get .025 and .012). Multiply both fractions above your original investment amount i.e.: ($5000* .025) ~= $125 [and likewise] ($8000 *.012)=~$96. Subtracting current values obtained previously allows us figure out approximate prospective profits generated via said choices ----$125+$96=$<<125+96=221>>221 accordingly.

Subtract these values individually computed above from initial investments i.e., subtract the current valuation/cost from projected future costs because when considering profits gained during stock exchange operation both buyers & sellers look into earning through differences bw 'value received'-\"initial_investment\". Therefore the resulting answers indicate overall net revenue changes anticipated based upon mentioned estimations provided by your professional consultant who used economic trend models predictively correlated across specified time intervals thus further influencing decisions towards optimizing returns whilst keeping certain risk factors under management parameters considered acceptable industry standards which may vary among entities engaging diverse types such tradable assets involving variations around numerous other key aspects including liquidity levels associated portfolios alongside impact sensitivities affective performance indices often reflectivity metrics etc..

From these calculations, buying the electronics yield higher return even though its percentage growth rate was lower than purchasing the Jewelry piece because both percentages calculated above refer only about price appreciation; however when considering absolute change (i.e., actual dollar amount) Electronic Gadgets show better potential Returns hence resulting into Maximum Profit gaining over time due to significantly larger initial investment involved as compared to Diamond Purchase Plan options mentioned hereinforth.
