We need find our post-tip/post-delivery fees amount first though . It goes like : Post-Delivery Fee Total Cost=(Pre Tax Food Price)*(1+(Delivery percentage))*(Tip). Or we could also say it as:(Post Tipping Amount)/((Percentage Of Pretaxis Charge)(Total Without Service Charges)). Here let us use percentages instead because using fraction form makes things easier when dealing wth decimals later..

To find it use our math rule about percentages. Multiply percentage (.2 when written as decimal just remove dot)(number);(.2)*($20)=4$.
