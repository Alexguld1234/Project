This equals (1/3)\u00d7750 = 250 , so finally we subtract what was added during both phases ; i.e.,  250+250 (=500), meaning that ultimately 1000 \u2013 500=500 remain undone.

To summarize... We start off knowing only one fourth went inside before grandma gets involved \u2013 thus starting point being four fifth instead than three quarters like most would assume without taking these earlier steps along; however once finished counting both sets combined bring everything around making sure every single last spot matches perfectly forming entire picture correctly within boundaries defined upon arrival home later during dinner conversation amongst families including extended relatives present throughout year long holidays period..

        " which equals 1000/4=250; Secondly, calculate the amount left by subtracting this from the original count (i.e., 1000-(250)=750).

Next calculate how many remain when you take away one third as well; here again consider using your leftover amount rather than reapplying it into its original value meaning use previously derived remainder i.e.: We know that our previous result equaled seventy-five hundred or seven-hundredths...so let's figure out how far removed three parts equal within those initial parameters \u2014 namely four\u2026in terms of division if needed..\u2014but since dividing results yield numbers such half . , etc.-there isn\u2018t quite any point!

Firstly, according to Condition 2 above we subtract one quota (i.e., 250), so before adding any new piece it leaves us with exactly half (condition i) or 500 pieces which correspond condition B (\"half\"). Secondly when addition starts, another quantitative characteristic changes as explained hereinabove because even though only three times less than four times this quantity was removed initially yet all other characteristics remain equal including its being equally divided into ten parts since none were ever considered separately nor exchanged among themselves but simply merged together once combined henceforth called 'all'.

However strictly speaking if we want precise numbers without any approximation hereafter no piece was changed due to half portion or other division method as used above but just following exact fractions i.e., Quarter=\u00bc(i.e.=25%) & Third=\u2153(i.e.=approximately equals=(~)=33.(repeating)).
