Add both quantities together (`20` plus `40`) yields the sum needed here i.e., `\\(\\text{instructions\\_total} = 20 + 40\\)`, thus equals `60`. Hence this case requires `60` reads (steps) because instruction refers not just reading but also carrying out these steps; therefore we assume them equivalent when referring about execution time hence requiring equal amount either way if only considering action taken regardless of prior/additional knowledge gained during said actions etc.. But since executing any process suchlike taking care off pets without knowing whether you can feed water beforehand makes sense even less practically unless combined processes include acquiring relevant understanding through guidance! Therefore assuming identical count applies equally across all stages including potential 'understanding'. Finally consider context importance \u2013 could imply certain specific circumstances apply like cookbooks may differ greatly based upon audience demographics & interests whilst other general sources remain constant due similarities among common ingredients used within those particular cuisines\u2026 Alternatively might mean different people perform tasks differently depending largely personal preferences eg ordering online instead going physical stores vs direct delivery methods perhaps availability options varying vastly throughout various regions worldwide).
