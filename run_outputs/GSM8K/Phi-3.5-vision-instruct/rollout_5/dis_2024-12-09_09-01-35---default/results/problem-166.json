This means this situation simplifies down mathematically into just taking the amount required over received quantities which results in \\( \\frac{15}{3} \\) or simply fifteen / three resulting in  5 . Therefore sandra would need to take care off kids precisely fifty percent less than those demanded if these egg supplies come without any loss during receipt.. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether such losses happen here though since none was mentioned; therefore let us work under conditions optimal towards reaching desired goals ; thus requiring exactly ten trips round about till all targets become fulfilled using provided stock limits along side calculated demands according established criteria stated earlier above described respectively ..
