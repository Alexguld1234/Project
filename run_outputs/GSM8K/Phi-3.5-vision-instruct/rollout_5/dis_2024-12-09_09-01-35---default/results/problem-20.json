You start off mixing this original volume plus our extra poured mixture which totals up to (20+15) liters. We already know that if mixed properly without any loss like yours due to its density factor would equal out being around(4x)/7 . This becomes close enough to roughly ((5.33+(4*(15)))/(20-(1/3)). All these multiplies through divide down until ending up getting [(172)+1)=173]/[(60)-3)= [173]/[57].

        " we subtract those who poured since this problem states about adding liquids into another liquid so the amount reduced would simply equal out whatever was removed without affecting other quantities which means our initial amounts stay same even though different physical measures but still count towards overall volume i.e., if you remove part or all , only its quantity changes not anything else . As such when calculating just calculate based off pure volumes instead than weight etc\u2026 (Note : Since no mention made regarding density differences due various ingredients involved henceforth any calculations purely shall revolve around respective contents themselves exclusively thus maintain uniformity throughout further evaluations).

We get roughly equal results when calculating first & second term separately before summing them together because adding up fractions directly leads us through unnecessary steps like dividing numerators or denominators which can cause further rounding errors so remember always work this way especially within such scenarios involving mixing liquids whose content percentages might differ wildly apart but volumes combined exactly match those involved while being mixed simultaneously here instead than simply plugging our numbers straight away without proper understanding why its happening etc.. First time let\u2019s find amounts present initially prior starting addition operations i mean considering individual components along w/rather treating their proportions themselves ; thus both ingredients amount totals approximately remain constant even once adjustments occur accordingly! Therefore following earlier mentioned logic above regarding solving said problem effectively yields correct values ultimately despite seemingly complex processes needed behind scenes .. As per instructions provided initial solution seemed simple however incorrect reasoning was applied thereby leading me mistaken conclusion :( Please help clarify doubts!!!!!
