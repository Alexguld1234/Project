([[(Fully Filled\u2212Used] +[Space Left Inside Of Tank When New Refresh Stops Flowing])]/ [Amount Consumed Per Mile])) .So putting numbers through formula get following solution:[{ [(12 gals\u20144gls.]+.[Rest Spaces Within Storage Units]]}/{(Milestrate_Per_Gall)} or {[(12 \u2014\u00a04]+[Unfilled spaces]*){Drivelable Miles}}{One Unit}.or ({[{\u2004\u2003\u2003\u2009\u2003[\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 ]}]}) which equals \u200a\u200a\u200a{{{[8][space within Container]}}}\u00d710={{drivable miles} }\u200a.Now just simplify equation {{[[[[[({( [{[:math:`\\bigstar`}]...\u200c\u200b*}]*)*]:\r",
        " go (12 / .04) = 300 miles without refueling or stopping anywhere along the way. Therefore, including driving distance already covered when half empty i.e., initial travel till stop which equals ((tank_capacity*half)/miles)*(remaining+initial), hence Total possible range=((tank_full*.5/.04)+initial )=(tank_full/.08 +initial)=Total Range Travelable Distance With Gas Available "
