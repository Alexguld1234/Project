Therefore, over one full week, or seven days including both the weekend and regular working/schooling days, Pancho walks  100 + 20= 120 miles altogether. Hence, according to this assumption pancho walks around 120 miles in one complete week. However, if Weekends here implies four days off instead of just Saturdays & Sundays combined hence considering them not included it means during those three normal schooling / work days alone, walking daily, so no changes occur thus ,the calculation remain same except removing out weekend calculations resulting into him Walking all other six Days(Mon Thur Wed Fri Sat Sun) i.e.,for these Six Day period amount totals up exactly as mentioned above but without adding extra because already considered earlier .Hence calculating again taking whole Seven Day Period once Normal School/Work Time Additional Holiday also calculated using same formula becomes Again : 10*5+10*(number_of_weekend_Days)= 120Miles This time Total comes Out Beeing Just Same As Calculated Earlier Which Indicatesthat Whether Assumption Made Is Different Or Not Doesn\u2019t Change Anything Final Count Stays Consistent Regardless It Only Means One Of Two Things Must Have Happened Either All Seen Over Here Referring Back To Previous ",
        " 5*20=100 miles (since we assume one month starts usually beginning Monday). During Saturday and Sunday he only walks half as far, so 2*10 = 20 extra miles walked during weekend . Adding up both results we get 100+20 =  120. The answer is: 120.",
        " add up what happens over the course of one full weekend (two nonconsecutive weekdays), or Saturday/Monday \u2013 this means adding another 10 miles onto our calculation above; therefore during both weekspan periods combined you get :   $$(5*20)+(2*10)$$ ,which equates into $$100+20=$$$120$$.

This means over the course of entire week including weekdays plus weekend; pancho goes about covering additional distances equivalent to twice pertaining value mentioned earlier because this extra mileage was actually split across both ends \u2013 Weekday&Weekend combined hence comes out pretty close too if not identical!
