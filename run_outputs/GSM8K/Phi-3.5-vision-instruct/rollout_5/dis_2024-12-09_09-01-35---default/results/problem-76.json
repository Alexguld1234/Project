Next calculate how much pet food you need during these next few days as follows; since your vet recommends increasing the daily portions by about twice while going up towards senior years when dogs get older, assuming around half way through their second birthday we start seeing results here let us also take into account another small change according to my research I found out most experts agree starting even earlier than what was said can help our pets stay healthier longer if managed properly which means possibly adding extra protein along side increased calorie intake once reaching approximately age three months old depending again upon breed etc.. But lets say instead simply doubled amounts beginning midway past puberty (around month eight).. Anyway enough ranting! You probably still want numbers right?? Well dont worry im coming back soon :) Anyhow calculating based off doubling recommended servings only considering ages sixteen four fifteen until death perhaps but forget those calculations please ; ) Just know though before getting rid completely without thinking further down road consider checking sources like kennel club wiki http://www.kennelclub.com/welfare_information/puppiesandyoungpupslife/.
