Applying our original scenario here too; first, six emerge while hidden, resulting in four visible (eight plus three). But when subtracting those who later conceal themselves behind rocks (-two), it leaves us still with just two unhidden tadpoles being observed by Finn.

It leaves us simply knowing only what Finan shows during observation time; therefore leaving original count which means since no new observations happened nor subtractive events took place besides initial sights hence this maintains their presence yet unchanged as seen before thus resulting back into being same numbers witnessable meaning **Original Count** here refers merely towards first sightings i.e., just counting appearances rather alterations due following actions mentioned like emergences & disappearances post these incidents occurring subsequent visits aren\u2019t needed unless clarity states otherwise affecting continuation through multiple viewings impact needs explicit confirmation else assumed constant over said span without influence change upon recurrence views within context implying non dynamic shifts amidst continuous checking periods thereby keeping track static irrespective changes brought about anytime past/present moments till latest update timestamp indicating timelessness regarding figures observed per snapshot regardless temporal evolution dynamics amongst entities listed subjectively perceived across chronological spans suggesting invariant nature retainment persists steadfastly despite external variables fluctuations ensuing consequential effects propagated systematically throughout observational trajectory whilst preserving constancy via periodic inspections ensuring accuracy maintained consistently upheld rigorously applying precise evaluations against benchmark criteria establishing reliable standardized measurements based heavily grounded empirical data supported scientific methodologies utilizing quantitative analysis techniques assessed objectively devoid emotion fueled interpretations relegating arbitrary decisions discarding human bias potentially influenced personal prejudices hindering impartial judgments skewed distortions leading erroneous conclusions drawn hasty premature dismissals favor misguided assessments causing confusion misunderstanding incorrect inferences generating falsehood errors creating unnecessary discrepancies breeding conflict hamper progress stifle creativity suppress innovation limit potential opportunities restrict growth obstruct success undermine efforts promote failure diminish morale demoralize personnel induce stress exert pressure inflict anxiety trigger panic escalate friction ignite turmoil provoke hostility create divisions foment strife instigate chaos disturb order destabilize harmony upset balance erode unity foster division isolate individuals group marginalize factional separatism",
        " When 6 came out of their hiding place, this increased the count to 11+6=17. But when later 2 hid again, it reduced down to 17-2=15 TADPOLES remaining visible. The answer is: 15.",
        " question according to what it states here :   six emerge . It means before eight came back into sight so far ten ( eleven minus one) could seen currently..And than four go away as hidden behind rocks which leaves only those who are visible right now i.e.six coming up again lesser no 'four'. Hence these twenty three(ten plus twelve equals nineteen ) comes into view presently but subtraction needs also accounting unseen figures such as ones not being exposed yet or even beneath substrate like mud etc .. As stated this time round too fewer numbers namely just seven still remains invisible !

However if you meant \u2018first\u2019 referring to what occurred immediately before counting again during their observed time frame; let's solve based upon initial observation count since all other events happened subsequently within same timeframe not changing immediate visual quantification: At 'first', right after observing but prior to additional actions involving said subjects\u2014meaning just once seen without interactions causing visible change/movement directly impactful enough to affect overall quantity visually perceived straight away -- which corresponds correctly according to sequence described hereof instances pertaining specified subject matter concerned identified earlier part henceforth shall qualify thereby establish direct relevancy connecting explicitly denoted explicit mentionation found previously mentioned specifically enumerated detail indicating particular point reference otherwise unacknowledged thus far nor considered worthwhile inclusion beyond basic description merely provided above implying subsequent action effects potentially influence actuality outcome yet absence comprehensive disclosure relating individual event occurrence specificities precluding definitive determination possible exclusively drawing correlation amongst sequential observational points existing distinctly differentiable apart separate scenarios nonetheless presuming singular focus throughout analysis process ensuring precision accuracy accordingly yield resultant figures derived entirely groundless assumptions devoid reliable factual bases necessitating reliance strictly verifiable observable phenomenon solely allowing no deviation adherence exactitude standard established consistency upheld integrity maintenance safeguarding legitimacy authentic context maintained valid application purposefully executed methodically systematically proceed logically analytical reasoning conclusions reached thoroughly substantiated verified accurate conclusion obtained definite value expressed succinct resolution satisfactorily achieved objective attainment successfully concluded efficiently solved problem effectively resolved accurately calculated correct resulting precise computed solution obtain satisfying satisfied met goal accomplished completed fulfilled target destination aim achieved realized successful achievement accomplishment realised conquest fully performed task dispatch finished function delivered complete output generated whole work product emerging refined craftsmanship fruits laboriously reaped rich harvest gathered bountiful crop produced abundant wealth prosperous fortune accrued treasure trove amassed hoard stashed vault full repository stockpile cache supply store accumulated asset collection portfolio diverse range options multiple pathways alternatives various routes choices myriad decisions plethora variety opportunities potential prospects numerous possibilities array extensive assortment wide selection spectrum broad sweep diversified vast multifaceted complex complications",
        " out, which makes it 11+6=17. Next thing happened was when he found  2 hid away making the new count (of what could still seen) as follows; 17-(2)=15. This means there\u2019d be no hidden ones remaining meaning only these existing or currently visible would remain/be counted. Hence, there'd ultimately just be those same original \u2018seen\u2019 15 this time around(past counting including coming back). Therefore, Finland actually counts all but none 'hidden'. ",
        "\u2019s subtracting 6 from 11, so we get 11 - 6 = 5 visible tadpoles remaining after this sighting. Next, when it comes up again (so far), half the group hides away behind rocks \u2013 remove another 2 as per your question, meaning you take these 2 hidden ones off our current count. This makes us calculate 5(remaining) minus 2 resulting into just 3 visible or free spots anymore where new tadpoles may appear around him while counting what remained unseen till yet due to being partially covered/hidden amongst background debris & stuff inside water body itself along edges etc.. So yes if someone wants all things straight forward without considering other factors like size changes over time nor variations depending upon seasonality effects related towards their environments especially during different weather conditions throughout springtime months ahead; my conclusion would simply state something about having \u2018visibility issues\u2018 rather than stating actual numbers available presently based solely physical presence alone but taking account various real life aspects affecting appearances such fluctuations owning impact overall results expected henceforth accordingly thus causing discrepancies leading further complications later down lineage despite initial intentions made previously concerning determination process undertaken early last year only via numerical means albeit theoretical considerations notwithstanding direct measurements executed personally backstage setting sans any preliminary research necessary beforehand conducted specifically aimed toward providing insights regarding accuracy achieved post completion therefore enabling greater clarity surrounding subject matter involved thereby facilitating decision making steps initiated forthcoming period following events unfold subsequently occurring within said context involving affected individuals seeking answers relating outcome implication visibly apparent herein currently shown above consequentially generating potential misunderstandings among parties participating actively amidst present circumstance whilst simultaneously ignoring possibility alternative routes attainable provided sufficient resources requisite obtain specific solution desired effectively bridging divide dividing opposing camps comprising diverse factions supporting differing views opposed contrary standpoints held firm resolve remain steadfast regardless setback obstacles faced daily prevent complete consensus reached satisfactory compromise possible maintain focus concentrated effort required persistently striving successive victorious endeavors ensuring no one side entirely dominate situation completely winning battle decisive winner emerges ultimately clear choice wins round everyone acknowledges achievement commemorating victory proclaimed officially celebrated collectively wholeheartedly embracing pride joyfully rejoicing accomplishments earned hard work paid dividends finally culmination arrived triumph",

However, it doesn\u2019t exclude possibility that other unknown 'unseen' group may exist adding up totals above this base figure.
