This kinda makes us really need specific information before making definitive statements though because everyone consumes something differently everytime whether it comes down specifically saying prices/cost ranges within categories compared across time periods throughout life versus simply listing average costs listed yearlongly vs decades back rather than month long variations observed here annually during certain seasons like summer months perhaps; however generally speaking... we might say approximately twenty eighty seven plus seventeen forty percent off ($21/$12) discount applied directly towards savings earned due mostly around holidays while shopping online using credit cards provided immediately following checkout process completion usually happens automatically unless otherwise instructed according personal settings preferences set prior doing same thing once again later followed closely afterwards next instance whenever possible typically occurring rarely anywhere particularly often least likely most commonly happening frequently almost guaranteed eventually becoming commonplace routine occurance expected near future especially amongst consumers currently undergoing financial struggles presently going through difficult times periodically experiencing hardship situations causing economic downturn impact affecting majority population overall nationwide level globally regardless country status location current geopolitical affairs matters related primarily social unrest involving local residents groups active participants against corrupt government officials seeking justice equality rights fair treatment protection civil liberties freedom individual self autonomy responsibility accountability citizenship role contribution society benefit citizenry welfare public healthcare education employment stability retirement income security job market prosperity capitalist free enterprise system laissez faire philosophy competition competitive advantage entrepreneurial spirit innovation creativity problem solving skill development growth opportunity wealth accumulation success achievements accomplishments goal setting aspirations career advancement professionalism work ethic integrity moral character discipline determination motivation passion dedication commitment focus concentration attention detail orientation patience humility respectfulness appreciative gratitude recognition thanksgiving joy happiness contentment satisfaction fulfillment purpose enthusiasm ambition drive persistence resolve confidence belief faith",
