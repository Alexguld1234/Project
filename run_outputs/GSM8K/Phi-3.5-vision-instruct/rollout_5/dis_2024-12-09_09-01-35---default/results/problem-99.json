Hence when subtracting it off , you get 80+ 18-(9)*2 =::69-> remaining..The answer is: 69.",
        " it was equal to what she ended up having yesterday plus the newly arrived ones (that\u2019s why this needs no accounting). Hence last night Mary had 80+18=98 different potting plants; or if not so explicitly mentioned every single one because all previous calculations imply that before adding those brought recently none was removed nor transferred anywhere else either during transportation itself neither when leaving their packages indoors uncared properly as required here but these specific additions could only take place once inside said house without taking out any other than previously owned since otherwise nothing would change regarding ownership even though location may differ hence removing them completely entirely negates whatever work went into obtaining additional quantities afterwards making such transfers useless unless doing just so solely due reasons stated above thus being highly likely indeed worthwhile merely despite cost effectiveness considerations alone also considering possible damages caused thereby causing greater loss overall although still avoidable through careful handling especially while moving things around outside your own property boundaries yet ensuring full safety throughout process regardless whether intentionality remains clear intention based actions performed strictly within domestic area exclusively involving persons who happen upon same scene accidental occurrence rather anything beyond localized physical interaction resulting directly correlated results therefore potentially leading toward unwanted consequences altogether including financial losses associated primarily stemming largely along economic line items related specifically towards purchasing replacement supplies etc whilst simultaneously prevent negative repercussions arising elsewhere via personal injury claims levied against involved parties albeit lacking criminal charges applicable under certain conditions depending mostly heavily dependent factors ranging widely varied across jurisdictions worldwide covering numerous countries spanning continents comprised among several others geographically separated significantly apart physically distant thousands miles perhaps far exceeding entire earth radius combined together allowing virtually limitless scope enabling extensive global cooperation networks established over decades ago designed purposefully constructed platforms accessible online instantaneously thanks modern technology developed progress rapidly growing technological innovations constantly improving capabilities continuously upgrading hardware software applications increasing speed efficiency reliability functionality performance availability ease accessibility versatility compatibility interoperability support services provided round twenty four seven customer friendly approach offering comprehensive assistance programs complement standard protocol requirements providing reliable consistent quality assured products available whenever needed wherever desired convenient affordably priced options readily purchased cheap easily shipped discreet package design eliminating potential exposure issues created unsafe environments existing prior known hazards present threats recognized risks encountered situations demand attention caution vigilance proactivity planning strategic course execution monitoring feedback analyzing trends predicting patterns",
        " 80+18=98 plants so far. Today, she plans to donate one plant per windowsill or (one out of every) fourteen (since twelve minus eight plus three(prefers not having none)). We know this would bring us down seven (because forty divided into seventeen leaves fifteen remainder ten). At least twenty planets wouldn\u2019t go up because there aren't enough available ones. Hence it brings our count down further than what was planned above meaning only thirty remaining plants as opposed the forty stated beforehand if all went according to initial intention. Thus finally amounting totals fifty six altogether! Although I tried making sense through division but ended ending calculating fractions instead leading off onto unwanted answers here below again without knowing exactly about whether actual numbers matter regarding who gets fewer amongst themselves yet wanting everyone satisfied whilst maintaining balance thus creating such discrepancies while ensuring nobody ends up being unhappy among them due lack resources etc.. Also note however although most people might suggest using subtraction directly rather like simply subtract everything except last example mentioned earlier; even though sometimes seems easier still consider multiplications first following similar logic behind same idea shown previously involving simple counting methods used elsewhere throughout history despite seemingly complicated math required during specific timeframes requiring extra consideration towards certain variables within equations involved especially related particularly relevant case scenarios encountered commonly these occurrences involve several different factors contributing heavily influence outcome obtained eventually based solely upon assumptions made accordingly whenever doing calculations relating specifically connected particular instances occurrence situations described subsequently referred therefore causing significant differences caused ultimately resultant consequence arising naturally evolving over period long continuation thereby significantly impacting overall results yield calculated values determined consequentially generated henceforth resulting effect evident immediately apparent regardless respective views opinions held strongly favorably supporting desired goals strived achieve realistically attainable objectives aim true purpose fulfilled effectively achievement success accomplished satisfactorily satisfying intended purposes sought truly accomplish worthy endeavors undertaken successfully pursued achieved fully potentialized best possible outcome realized actually obtainability practicably realizable possibilities inherent possibility existing necessarily necessitated eventuality demanded absolute commitment entireheartedly devoted unwaveringly resolved steadfast committed firm resolve determination fortitude courage bravery indomitable spirit resolute faith never wavering persistence effort expended entirely dedicating wholehearted devotion earnest intentions dedicated goal orientated mission vital importance paramount considering necessary steps essential prerequisites preparations needed completion prior successful concludes task completed job finished work assigned complete responsible"
