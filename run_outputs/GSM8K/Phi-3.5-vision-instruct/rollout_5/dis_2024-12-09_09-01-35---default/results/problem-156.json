Since it says 'every other month', or over any period spanning exactly one year ('a few years'), this doesn't change our current calculation because these animals eat daily so twice as often might affect their diet but not necessarily double what was calculated previously; therefore if you multiply our earlier result found i.e., 700bananas \u00d7 2= 1,400 bananas would cover both periods equally spaced apart without taking additional factors into consideration such us seasonal variations like rain etc..

This question requires us calculating both quantities because we require enough foodstuff across different time spans while also taking into account variations among animals (different species). Since it mentions feeding twice within one calendar year rather than just once therefore you would double what was calculated before multiplying again by another factor based off those same calculations but only counting halfway through so when your original summation included everything happening during their standard daily routine without any further variation; hence its best practice firstly dividing out initial sums accordingly prior considering other factors such growth rates which could affect these figures slightly due age differences amongst them etc... When averaged together however yields lesser numbers compared directly obtained previous steps above since adjustments might lead towards smaller amounts owing mostly natural fluctuations associated primarily toward individual needs changing according seasons available resources throughout annual cycle thus why generally speaking people tend prefer round figure approximations whereas using exact values helps improve accuracy somewhat reducing margin error margins .

        " group of animals: Monkeys (200) + Gorillas(400) + Baboons(100). This equals 700 bananas per month. To find out how many bananas are required over 2 months multiply this amount by 2 :  700*2=1400 . Thus, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas if we want them delivered twice within one year which means their delivery would come once every other month so since it states 'every 2 months', hence no extra calculations are necessary resulting in him having ordered correctly according to requirements specified initially making our calculation irrelevant; however considering realistic scenarios or potential changes like canceled shipments/deliveries etc., ordering exactly as calculated minimizes risks associated with shortage thus ensuring adequate food supply even when unforeseen situations arise such fluctuation rate might occur leading us into deeper analysis adjusting frequency slightly beyond what was requested , taking various factors including environmental impacts animal diet variations seasonality demands availability costs storage capacity along among others but still stay true core values towards caretakers obligations yet keeping economic sustainability intact accordingly suggesting possible alternative schedules could better suit these objectives while fulfilling basic duties mentioned without compromising health welfare safety standards ultimately seeking balanced approach address current issue whilst planning long term viable efficient nutrition distribution plan respectfully avoiding direct suggestion here implying exploration opportunities further optimizing situation maintain optimal living conditions safeguarding future prospects simultaneously satisfying immediate necessities preservation remains priority always accounting variables influencing decision effectiveness aim achieving most beneficial overall outcome regardless constraints faced adapt flexibly incorporate ideas innovative technologies implement measures improvement continuously strive excellence achieve zenith reach together collectively ensure best serves interests everyone involved foster progress promote wellbeing enhance habitat quality elevate experiences enjoyment benefits contribute positively community advancement forward constructive growth harmoniously coexist symbiotically interdependent support mutual prosperity uphold shared responsibilities honor traditions value principles embrace diversity celebrate inclusivity understand complex context appreciate intricacies integrate holistic perspectives formulate comprehensive strategy prioritize critical aspects meticulous deliberation assess pros cons analyze data quantify results evaluate success criteria set benchmark goals establish key performance indicators identify trends spot areas requiring attention pinpoint challenges overcome obstacles mit",
        " bananas, and baboons need 100 bananas. Total required banana count would thus equal 200+400+100=700 . Since you\u2019re looking for quantities over two weeks/two months , just multiply this value(the quantity) times  2 ; hence we get; 700*2 =>=> 1400 Bananas ordered.. This means if these amounts hold constant ( no new animals being born or dying), one could conclude the person who handles food purchases needs to purchase roughly about 1400 units or sacks as long their lifespan goes beyond any unforeseeable events .. We can solve this problem using simple arithmetic operations i.e addition and multiplication which yield results based solely on values presented within question itself without relying upon external data sets such information available online regarding dietary requirements specific breeds etc unless explicitly asked otherwise : ** ",
        " equals 700 bananas per month needed altogether. Since he wants enough food for only 2 months, multiply this value by 2 (Because we want twice as long). This results into 700*2= 1400 Bananas required over two months time frame. ",
        " every 2 months, we just multiply this quantity by 2 which equate to 700*2=1400bananas. Therefore, The "
