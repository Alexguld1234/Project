Therefore jean who is two year younger has twenty years minus one which means nineteen but since human cannot grow back their hair overnight I believe Jean turned eighteen earlier yesterday or last night!

Considering we take into account only these few months when both boys became teenagers let us say approximately one year passed since their birthdays; We add another year because those first three sum up four times twelve... This brings the resultant calculation out as follows: It would mean that currently youngest child marks its sixth anniversary thus being sixteen years already, while elder brother reaches seventeen (six plus ten). Since our problem statement explicitly told about 'Jan', not John or Jeffy who presumably meant younger brothers/friends here but rather stated names starting strictly alphabetically beginning again following Jamey \u2013 consequently implying Jane herself exists within said grouping!
