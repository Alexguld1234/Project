Given we convert our available times into comparable units i.e., both being measured as 'hours', let us change half an hour or .5 hr , expressed traditionally, back into its equivalent amount written like any other quantity; namely: .5hr = (.5*.60)*60sec/minute =~30 seconds(note :we use decimal notation throughout). As such... Speed during your second round equals Distance over Time=(distance walked)/time required=. Hence when all quantities are accountedfor you find out just exactlythatyouneedtowalkthose~sixmileswithalittleremainingsoonerthanexpected:-(.speedrequired)=6mi/(halfanhour.)==>(or alternatively)(6mi/.5hr) == >  12 mi/hr That concludes my current thinking process!

        " know Marissa already spent 1 hr walking the initial part plus another 1hr+x hrs=total time so far.

Since we want negative sign outside but no minus signs inside brackets, simply switch sides yielding:-speed<=(totalspeedsanddistance/(TotaldistanceMinusDistanceAlreadyCovered)), which further simplifies into: -Time TakenForLastPartToBeDone><==>[averagestepeach|_||(|left behind)|tofinish] , plugging everything together results in :-SpeedNeeded<=[(TotalMileageToGoLeftAfterCurrentStepOfHike)-((AverageStepsPerThousanSeconds)*(TimeSpentSoFar))]this case equals:(TotalMilageToFinishThisLoop\u2013(Avgstepsperseconds*currentnumberofsecondsusedsinceStart)).
