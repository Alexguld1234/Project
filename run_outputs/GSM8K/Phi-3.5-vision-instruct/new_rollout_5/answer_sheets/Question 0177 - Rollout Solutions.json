Firstly, we find out the times for each half. Half the distance (50 miles) at 40 mph will take 50 / 40 = 5/4 hours or 1.25 hours. Secondly, the other half covered at 80 mph will require less time because the speed is higher; hence 50 / 80 = 5/8 hours or approximately 0.625 hours. We sum these two times to get the total duration: 1.25 + 0.625 = 1.875 hours. The average speed can then be found by dividing the total distance by this total time. Therefore, 100 miles divided by 1.875 hours equals 53.33 mph when rounded to two decimal places.

To find the average speed, we add up the times for both halves and divide the total distance by this sum. Total time = 1.25 + 0.625 = 1.875 hours.
