First, we need to find out how long it took to complete the entire journey using different speeds. We know the distances covered at both speeds but not the times taken separately.

Let T1 be the time spent covering the first 180 miles at 60 mph, and T2 be the time spent covering the last 180 miles at 90 mph. To make sure this works, let us write down what we know: Distance_first_half = 180 miles, Speed_first_half = 60 mph, Time_first_half = T1. Similarly, Distance_second_half = 180 miles, Speed_second_half = 90 mph, Time_second_half = T2. Therefore, we can set up the following equations: Distance_first_half / Speed_first_half = Time_first_half (1) Distance_second_half / Speed_second_half = Time_second_half (2) Substituting our known values into those equations yields: 180 / 60 = T1 (3) 180 / 90 = T2 (4) Solving equation (3), we get T1 = 3.
