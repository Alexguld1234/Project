In the original 20% solution, the amount of solute can be found as follows: Since it's a percentage problem, we need to convert percent into decimal form (1/100) so it becomes easy for us to calculate easily. Therefore, 20% would become 0.2 or 20/100. So 90 liters of a 20% solution contains 0.2 * 90 = 18 liters of solute. To convert from liters to milliliters, multiply by 1000 since 1 liter equals 1000 milliliters. Therefore, 18 liters * 1000 ml per liter = 18000 ml of solute.

You start with 90 liters of a 20% solution which means you have 90 * 0.2 = 18 liters of solute. When you add 10 liters of pure substance without any concentration mentioned, you now have 90 + 10 = 100 liters of liquid but only 18 liters of solute remain because the other 10 liters contain no solute. To find out what the new percentage is, divide the solute amount by the total volume and multiply by 100%. This yields (18 / 100) * 100% = 18%. However, this result doesn\u2019t make sense because adding water increases both the volume and the concentration. Instead, let's calculate the new concentration based on all the solute. Since you don't lose solute when you mix, the total amount of solute remains 18 liters. With the addition of the pure substance, the total volume is now 100 liters, making the new concentration (18 / 100) * 100% = 18%. But, this still seems off because adding pure liquid without any solute didn't change the volume of solute itself; it changed its distribution relative to the entire mixture. We cannot simply use the old concentration because our initial volume was not uniform throughout \u2013 part of it contained solute while another part was pure. So the correct method involves recognizing that the addition of the pure substance increased the overall amount of solute (which remained constant), but also increased the total volume of the mixture. As a result, the actual concentration decreases. \n\nTo find", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
