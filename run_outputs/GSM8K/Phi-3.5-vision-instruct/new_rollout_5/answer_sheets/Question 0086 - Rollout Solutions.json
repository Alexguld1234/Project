First, we need to find out what the marked price was. The merchant bought something for $150 and marked it up by 20%, so you would calculate $150 times 20% which equals $30. That adds up to a new, higher price of $150 + $30 = $180. After that, if the customer takes advantage of a 10% discount on this new marked price, you would first figure out what 10% of $180 is, which comes to $18. Subtracting this discount amount from the marked price, you subtract $18 from $180 gets you a remaining price of $162.
