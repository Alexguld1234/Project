If we buy 8 DVDs individually, it would cost us 8 times $15, which equals $120. However, if we buy 8 DVDs as a bundle (each bundle consisting of 4 DVDs), it would cost twice as much because we need 2 bundles to make up 8 DVDs. So the cost for the bundles would be 2 times $50, making it $100. Therefore, by buying in bundles, we can save $120 (the cost of buying individually) minus $100 (the cost of buying in bundles).
