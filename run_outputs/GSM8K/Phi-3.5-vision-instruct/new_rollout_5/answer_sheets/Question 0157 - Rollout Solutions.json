Let P represent the cost of the pen and E represent the cost of the pencil. Since the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, we can write this relationship as P = 2E. The total cost of both items is represented by P + E. We know that their combined cost equals $3. Therefore, we can set up the equation: P + E = 3. Substituting P for 2E, our new equation becomes 2E + E = 3. Combining like terms, we get 3E = 3. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that E = 1. This means the pencil costs $1. Since the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, it would therefore also cost $2. The sum of their costs would be $2 (pencil) + $1 (pen) = $3.
