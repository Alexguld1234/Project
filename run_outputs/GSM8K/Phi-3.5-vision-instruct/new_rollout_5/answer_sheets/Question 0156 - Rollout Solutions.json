Firstly, we need to convert miles into hours since we want to find out minutes per mile. Convert all distances and times to consistent units before calculating. For 3 miles in 30 minutes, it means 0.1 hours for this segment. For 2 miles in 20 minutes, it means 0.333... hours or approximately 0.33 hours when rounded to two decimal places. To calculate the average pace over the entire distance covered, add up the distances and divide by the total time spent running: (3 miles + 2 miles) / (30 minutes + 20 minutes) = 5 miles / 50 minutes = 0.1 hours per mile. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, multiply the result by 60 to get the average pace in minutes per mile: 0.1 hours/mile * 60 minutes/hour = 6 minutes per mile.\n\nThis question seems to present contradictory information based on the hint provided \u2013 one says the answer is 10 while another says it's 15.
