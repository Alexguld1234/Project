First, convert the problem into percentages. We know that if 60% of marbles are blue, which totals 72 marbles, we can find out what one percentage (for either color) represents: One percentage point equals 1/0.6 = approximately 1.67 marbles. Therefore, 40%, or the percentage of red marbles, represents 40 * 1.67 = approximately 67 marbles. However, since we rounded during calculation, let's adjust our numbers using exact values: With 72 blue marbles representing 60%, and knowing that the sum of percentages adds up to 100%, the red marbles would therefore make up the remaining 100% - 60% = 40%.
