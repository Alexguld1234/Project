To find the average cost, we need to calculate the weighted mean of these two values. \n\nSince we used equal parts, let's assume we used 1 kilogram of each. This means we have one kilogram priced at $8/kg and another kilogram priced at $12/kg. The average price would therefore be (1*$8 + 1*$12)/2 = $20/2 = $10/kg.\n\nSo the hint suggests that we assumed the same quantity (x kg) for each kind of coffee.
