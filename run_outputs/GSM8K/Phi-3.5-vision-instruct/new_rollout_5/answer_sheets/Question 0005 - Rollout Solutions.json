Let S represent the number of scarves and H represent the number of hats. We know S = (3/2)H because she makes 3 scarves for every 2 hats. Also, we know S + H = 50 since she made a total of 50 items. Substituting S with (3/2)H in the second equation, we get (3/2)H + H = 50. Combining terms, this becomes (5/2)H = 50. To find H, multiply both sides by 2/5 which simplifies to H = 50 * (2/5).
