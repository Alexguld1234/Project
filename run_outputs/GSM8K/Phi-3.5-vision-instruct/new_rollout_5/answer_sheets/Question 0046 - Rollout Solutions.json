Condition 1 tells us there are 50 students, and Condition 2 tells us that for every girl, there is one boy because of the ratio.", "2": "Since we know that for each girl there is also exactly one boy, it means if there are x girls, then there must be x boys too. Because of these conditions, the total number of students can be represented as 2x (because there is twice as many girls than boys).", "3": "Solve the equation for x using the information about the total number of students.

Firstly, considering the condition states that for every girl, there's one boy meaning their ratio remains consistent throughout, let's solve for the number of girls first. We have the equation 2x = 50 since every girl corresponds to another boy thus making them equal in quantity, therefore, we get x equals to half of the total number which comes out to be 25. Thus, the classroom comprises of 25 girls. Considering our initial hint regarding the consistency of ratio and knowing that each student i.e., girl or boy has a uniform cost, hence, there would naturally be 25 boys in the classroom representing the girls.
