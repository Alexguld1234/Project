To find out how long it took for the first part of the journey, we need to calculate the time. We know the speed was 30 mph and the distance was 30 miles. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we get Time = 30 / 30 hours which equals 1 hour. The answer is: 1 hour.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the average speed maintained throughout the entire 90-mile journey?", "subanswer": {"text": "The total distance traveled is 90 miles. The total time taken includes 1 hour for the first part, plus we would need to consider the times for the second and third parts; however, these times aren't provided, hence cannot be calculated accurately without additional information. Without knowing the exact duration or number of hours spent for each segment beyond the speeds provided, we can't determine an accurate average speed. The answer is indeterminate based on available data.", "value": 0.1875}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
