Here, our distance will still remain constant since the length of the train doesn't change but speed increases due to doubling effect. Hence, new time required can be determined asDistance/(Speed). This implies that the time taken is half because of the doubling factor being 2, i.e., (20/2) = 10 seconds.

Doubling the speed would not change the distance it needs to cover (which is equal to the length of the train) but rather how fast it covers this distance.
