There is a flat fee which stays constant irrespective of the duration of stay, and there is also a variable charge depending on the hours spent. We know the fixed cost ($10) and the hourly cost ($2), so let's calculate them separately. First, add up the flat fee: $10 (fixed). Next, multiply the number of hours (6) by the hourly rate ($2): 6 * $2 = $12. Now, combine these amounts to find out the total bill: $10 + $12 equals $22.
