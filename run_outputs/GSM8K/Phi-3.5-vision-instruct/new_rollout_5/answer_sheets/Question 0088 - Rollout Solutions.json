We know the total length of the rope was 60 meters, and we need to split it according to the ratio 2:3:5. First, let\u2019s find out what the value of each unit in the ratio is. To do this, we add up the parts of the ratio: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts. Next, we determine the value of each part: 60 meters / 10 parts = 6 meters per part. According to our ratio, the largest segment is represented by 5 parts, so its length before any adjustments is: 5 parts * 6 meters per part = 30 meters.\n\nNow let\u2019s check whether the original division resulted in a complete cut without leftover material, since it's possible the actual sizes may differ slightly due to the nature of how ropes are cut physically. Subtracting the sum of the other two segments from the total rope length: 60 meters - 30 meters (first segment) - (2 parts * 6 meters per part) - (3 parts * 6 meters per part) = 60 - 30 - 12 - 18 = 0 meters. No remainder, which confirms that the initial calculations worked accurately. Therefore, the calculated value of the third segment matches exactly with the second smallest segment; hence no further adjustments are needed.
