To set up our equations, if there are 50 heads, it means these are also the count of cows and dogs combined since every animal has exactly one head. Therefore, C + D = 50. Also, because of their limbs, a cow contributes 4 legs whereas a dog contributes 2 legs per animal. Thus, when we calculate the leg contribution from cows and dogs together, we get 4C + 2D = 140.
