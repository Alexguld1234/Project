Firstly, we know that the normal price of the item is $40. Under the deal, if you buy one, you can get another for half price. That makes the deal effective as buying one item at full price (which is $40), followed immediately by purchasing another one at half its original price (which is $40/2 or $20). Therefore, when you buy one item for $40 and add another at $20 using the same offer, it totals up to $40 + $20 = $60 per set under the deal. Since you bought 4 sets, you would calculate 4 sets times $60 per set which equals $240.
