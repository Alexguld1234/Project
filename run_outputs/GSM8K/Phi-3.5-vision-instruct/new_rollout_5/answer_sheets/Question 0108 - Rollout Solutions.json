So if we have (50 - X) chickens, since both have a head each, we can write our equation as 4X (legs from cows) + 2(50 - X) (legs from chickens). This equals 140 legs. So the equation is 4X + 2*50 - 2X = 140. Simplifying this gives us 2X + 100 = 140. Subtracting 100 from both sides gives 2X = 40. Dividing by 2 gives X = 20. Therefore, there are 20 cows.

We know that each cow has 2 legs and each dog has 4 legs since we don't count any other animals like sheep or goats here.
