We know the runner covers 2 miles at 8 mph. To find out how long it takes, we use the formula time = distance / speed. So, 2 miles divided by 8 mph equals 0.25 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply 0.25 hours by 60 (as there are 60 minutes in one hour). 0.25 * 60 = 15 minutes.

For the first half of the journey, which is 2 miles at 8 mph, using time = distance / speed, we get 2 miles / 8 mph = 0.25 hours or 15 minutes. For the second half, which is 4 miles at 6 mph, time = distance / speed gives us 4 miles / 6 mph = 0.67 hours or 40 minutes.
