We know that there are 40 candies in the packet. According to the problem statement, these candies are divided into several groups called portions or shares, which add up to all the candies. Each portion represents a fraction of the entire packet. To find out how many shares represent 1/5, first look at the total number of shares. Since every share adds up together to make the whole packet, if you want to calculate what happens when you remove a certain amount of shares, it\u2019s often easier to start by calculating exactly how many shares make up the whole packet\u2014a useful tip! So let's count out 5 shares: the first share starts off empty, but once you put your first candy in it, so there are 40 candies left to go. Now imagine adding one more share, filling it completely, leaving only 35 candies remaining. And so on until we have used all the candies and filled in all 5 shares... By counting this way, I found that 40 candies correspond perfectly to 5 shares. The answer is: 8.", "value": 0.78125}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
