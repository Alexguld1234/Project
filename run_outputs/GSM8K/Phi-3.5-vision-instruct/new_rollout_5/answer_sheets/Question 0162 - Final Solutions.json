Initially, we calculated the concentration as 75g sugar / 300ml solution = 25%, which matches our initial condition. But since 60mL of water evaporated, the total volume of the solution becomes 300 mL - 60 mL = 240 mL. We still need 75 grams of sugar because no additional sugar was added during evaporation. Now, divide the total sugar mass by the updated volume to find the new concentration: 75 g / 240 mL = 0.3125 g/ml or 31.25%.
