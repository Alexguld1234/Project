Firstly, let's calculate the time taken for both parts of the trip individually. Travelling 100 miles at 50 mph takes 100/50 = 2 hours. Similarly, travelling 100 miles at 25 mph takes 100/25 = 4 hours. Adding them together gives us the total time which is 2+4 = 6 hours. The total distance covered over all the trips adds up to 200 miles. Therefore, the average speed can be found using the formula speed = distance / time.
