We start with a 25% salt solution containing 240 ml.\n2. The goal is to dilute it to a 20% salt solution without changing the mass of the salt.\n\nFirstly, let's find out the mass of the salt in the initial solution. As we already know the concentration before dilution was 25%, which means that 25% of the 240 ml is salt:\nMass of salt initially = 25% of 240 ml = 0.25 * 240 ml = 60 ml.\n\nWe want to dilute this solution to make the concentration 20%. When diluting the solution, the mass of the salt remains constant since only water is being added, not salt. Therefore, the final volume of the 20% solution can still contain up to 60 ml of salt because the mass of the salt doesn't change, but the volume increases due to adding water.\n\nNow, if we consider 'x' as the additional volume of water to be added to the original 240 ml of saline solution, the new volume becomes 240 ml + x. This new volume should satisfy the condition of having 20% salt in the mixture:\n20% of (240 ml + x) equals 60 ml.\n\nSo the equation would look like this:\n0.20 * (240 ml + x) = 60 ml.\n\nSolving for 'x':\n60 ml = 0.20 * (240 ml + x),\n60 ml = 48 ml + 0.20x,\n60 ml - 48 ml = 0.20x,\n12 ml = 0.20x,\nx = 12 ml / 0.20,\nx = 60 ml.\n\nHowever, upon realizing that 60 ml is actually the total amount of water that must be added (not the remaining water volume), we see that no additional water is necessary\u2014this is already accounted for in the original 240 ml volume itself.\n\nThus, our conclusion reveals that no further addition of water is required to reach the target 20% concentration because the original volume contains precisely enough water to maintain the mass of the salt while achieving the desired concentration of 20% within the same volume. Hence, even though it seems counterintuitive based solely on the initial context, the volume of the solution could remain unchanged or increase only marginally when reaching the 20% concentration threshold.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would indicate no additional water is necessary under these circumstances.

Here, V1 is the initial volume (240 ml), C1 is the initial concentration (25% or 0.25), C2 is the final concentration (20% or 0.20), and V2 is the final volume (initial volume plus the volume of water added, which is 240 ml + x).
