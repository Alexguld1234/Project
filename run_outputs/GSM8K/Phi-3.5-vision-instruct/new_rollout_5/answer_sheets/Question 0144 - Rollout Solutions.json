The ratio of eggs to flour is 2:3, which means for every 2 parts of eggs, there are 3 parts of flour. First, we calculate the total parts as 2 (for eggs) + 3 (for flour) = 5 parts. Each part is equal to 60 / 5 = 12 grams. Since flour is represented by 3 parts, we multiply 3 by 12 grams per part to get 3 * 12 = 36 grams of flour needed.

Since the total weight is 60 grams and it corresponds to 5 parts (2 parts eggs and 3 parts flour), dividing the total weight by the total number of parts gives us the weight of one part: 60 g / 5 = 12 g per part. Next, since flour requires three such parts according to our 2:3 ratio, we multiply the weight of one part by three: 3 * 12 g/part = 36 g.
