Firstly, let's convert all times into the same unit so we understand both parts easily. We know that one hour has 60 minutes. Therefore, 2 hours equals 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Next, since the first part takes 15 minutes (or 1/10th of 1 hour), the machine fills 45 / (15 / 60) = 45 * (60 / 15) = 180 bottles per hour. Finally, as we need to find out how many bottles the machine can fill in 120 minutes, we multiply the hourly rate by 120 / 60, resulting in 180 * (120 / 60) = 360 bottles.
