First, let's establish the relationship between gasoline consumption (gallons) and the driving distance (miles). According to our hint, it takes 10 gallons to drive 200 miles. This means the car consumes gasoline at a rate of 10/200 gallons per mile. Next, using proportional reasoning, since we know the same efficiency applies when traveling any distance, we can set up the following proportion: \\(\\frac{10 \\text{ gallons}}{200 \\text{ miles}} = \\frac{x \\text{ gallons}}{500 \\text{ miles}}\\). To solve for \\(x\\), cross multiply to find that \\(200x = 10 \\times 500\\). Solving for \\(x\\) yields \\(200x = 5000\\); therefore, dividing both sides by 200, we get \\(x = \\frac{5000}{200} = 25\\).
