You can set up a proportion like so: 3/5 = x/40 (where 'x' represents the amount of sugar needed). To solve for 'x', multiply both sides of the equation by 40 (the denominator on one side), resulting in 3*40 = 5*x. Simplify this to get 120 = 5x. Then divide both sides of the equation by 5 to isolate 'x': 120 / 5 = x -> x = 24.

According to the given information, it states that for every 5 cups of flour used, 3 cups of sugar are required. With 40 cups of flour available, you first establish the ratio which is 3/5. This implies that for every 5 parts of flour, you also require 3 parts of sugar. Next, you want to find out how many times 5 goes into your total flour quantity, since you know that for each instance of 5 cups of flour, you need 3 cups of sugar. Dividing 40 by 5 gives us 8; this tells us that 40 divided by 5 equals 8, meaning you have 8 instances of 5 cups of flour. Since every time you take 5 cups of flour, you need 3 cups of sugar, multiplying these values together yields 8 instances * 3 cups of sugar per instance = 24 cups of sugar. Thusly, you would need 24 cups of sugar to match the flour quantity.
