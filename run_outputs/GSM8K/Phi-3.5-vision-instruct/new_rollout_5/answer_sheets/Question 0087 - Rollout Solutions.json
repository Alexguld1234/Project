Combining these, you get 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 of the nuts as either peanuts or almonds. This means cashews must account for the remaining part, which is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 of the nuts.

We first need to add up the fractions representing the known portions of the nut mix which are peanuts and almonds: 1/2 (peanuts) + 1/3 (almonds). To make it easier to calculate, find the common denominator, which is 6, so convert both fractions: 3/6 (peanuts) and 2/6 (almonds). They together account for 5/6 of the nuts. Since we already calculated before that the difference should be two-thirds of the nuts, not five-sixths, let's try again with proper calculations based on the hints provided. Calculating properly, 1/2 (peanuts) is equivalent to 3/6 and 1/3 (almonds) is equivalent to 2/6 when converted to sixths. Adding them yields 5/6 as expected. Therefore, the remainder represents the cashews portion, which would also mean it equals three-sixths of the total since 1 minus 5/6 leaves us with 6/6 - 5/6 = 1/6. Converting back into numbers related to the original quantity, if 1/6 corresponds to 120 divided by 6 (the total), then cashews would equate to 120 / 6, which calculates out to be 20. Finally, to confirm our previous incorrect result due to mathematical error, we check the summed value of known components versus what the remaining portion should represent: Peanuts and Almonds indeed sum to 5/6 of the total, and Cashews should correspond to 2/6 (or 1/3), making the calculation consistent upon revision.
