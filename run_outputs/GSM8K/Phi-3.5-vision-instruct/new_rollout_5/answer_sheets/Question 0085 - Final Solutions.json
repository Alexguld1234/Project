Firstly, we need to find out the new dimensions of the garden when the 1 meter path is added around it.

Therefore, the new length is 20 + 2 * 1 = 22 meters, and the new width is 10 + 2 * 1 = 12 meters.

The hint suggests multiplying these new dimensions to verify our calculation. It confirms that the area is indeed 400 square meters.
