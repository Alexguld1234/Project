Firstly, we know the ratio of flour to sugar in the recipe is 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar (2:3). Since we have 24 cups of sugar, let's figure out how many times this quantity fits into our 3-cup sugar portion. Divide the available sugar by the sugar part of the ratio: 24 / 3 = 8. This means that the sugar can make up 8 parts. Each part corresponds to one set of the original ratio (2:3), meaning each set includes 2 cups of flour. Thus, if 8 sets include 8 parts of sugar, then it also includes 8 parts of flour. 8 sets mean 8 * 2 cups of flour needed. 8 * 2 equals 16 cups of flour required.
