Time = 2 miles / 8 mph = 1/4 hours or 15 minutes. The answer is 15 minutes.", "value": 0.9}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we find out how long it takes the runner to complete 2 miles at 8 mph. We know that Time = Distance / Speed, so 1/4 hours (or 15 minutes) is required. Then, we need to calculate how long it would take for the runner to cover 4 miles at 6 mph. Using the same formula, Time = 4 miles / 6 mph = 2/3 hours (or 40 minutes). To get the total time, add the times together: 15 + 40 = 55 minutes. The answer is: 55 minutes.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
