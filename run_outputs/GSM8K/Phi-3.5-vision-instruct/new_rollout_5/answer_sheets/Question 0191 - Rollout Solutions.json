First, we need to calculate what happens during the first year when the phone loses 25% of its value. That means it retains 75% of its original price which is (75/100) x $800 = $600. Then next year, if you lose 10% of this new amount, it would mean $600 x (10/100) = $60 loss so the final value after the second year loss is $600 - $60 = $540.
