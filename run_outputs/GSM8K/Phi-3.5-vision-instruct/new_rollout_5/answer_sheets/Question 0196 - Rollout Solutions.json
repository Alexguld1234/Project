Firstly, let's find out how much salt was present initially. We know the whole solution contained 500 ml and that 20% of this was salt.

Therefore, the concentration remains the same even though the percentage calculation would change due to the reduced total volume.\n\nSo, new % = Amount of salt / New total volume * 100.
