The problem tells us that 2/7 of the fruits are pears, so if we set up a proportion, we can find out what part of the whole is made up of apples (the remaining fraction). Since 2/7 represent pears, then 5/7 represent apples because 1 - 2/7 = 5/7. We know that there are 84 pears, which means that those pears represent 2/7 of all the fruit. To find out the full amount of fruit (both apples and pears), we divide the number of pears by their fractional representation: 84 / (2/7) = 84 * (7/2) = 294. This is the total number of both types of fruit. Because 5/7 of these fruits are apples, we multiply 294 by 5/7 to find the number of apples: 294 * (5/7) = 210.

We know that pears represent 2/7 of all the fruits in the basket. This means that if we divide the total number of pears (which is 84) by 2/7, we get the original amount of pears before any were taken away or added. By doing so, we can find out what 1/7 represents, since 2/7 divided by 2 equals 1/7. Therefore, one 1/7 part would equal half of 84 pears, because 1/7 times 2 is 2/7, meaning 2 parts represent twice as many pears as 1 part. Hence, dividing 84 by 2 gives us 42, which corresponds to 1/7 of the total number of fruits in the basket. Multiplying 42 by 7 gives us the total number of fruits initially in the basket, resulting in 42 * 7 = 294 fruits. Since the problem states that 2/7 of these fruits are pears, subtracting the pear count from the total yields the number of apples.
