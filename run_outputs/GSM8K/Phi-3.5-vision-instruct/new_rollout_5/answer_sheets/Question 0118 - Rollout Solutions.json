The ratio of red to blue to green is 2:2:1. That makes it 5 parts in total because you add up all the numbers representing the different parts (2+2+1=5). Each part represents an equal amount of the whole, so we can divide the total number of beads by the number of parts to find out what one part is worth. Therefore, 100 / 5 = 20. This tells us that one part equals 20 beads. Since the green color represents only one part, Olivia has 20 beads that are green.
