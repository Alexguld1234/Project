To do this, we need to calculate 20% of the original price. We know that the original price was $500, so multiplying $500 by 20% (or 0.20 as decimal), we get $100. That means the discount is worth $100. Step 2: Next, subtract this amount from the original price to figure out how much the item costs after the discount. So, $500 - $100 = $400. Therefore, after applying the initial 20% discount, the phone sells for $400.\n\nStep 3: Add the sales tax to find out the total cost. The sales tax is calculated based on the reduced price, which is $400 in our example. Hence, calculating 8% of $400 results in $32. Adding these together gives us the grand total: $400 (price after discount) + $32 (tax) = $432. Thus, when including both the initial discount and the additional tax, one would pay $432 for the phone.
