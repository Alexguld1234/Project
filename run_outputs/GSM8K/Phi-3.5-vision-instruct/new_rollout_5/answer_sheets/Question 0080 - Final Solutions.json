Firstly, we need to find out how much Katie spends on notebooks and pens. The cost of one notebook is $4. So three notebooks cost 3 * 4 = $12. Each pen costs $2 (half the price of a notebook), so two pens cost 2 * 2 = $4. Adding them together, she spends 12 + 4 = $16. If she pays with a $50 bill, her change would be 50 - 16 = $34.
