We know that 2/7 of the fruits are pears, so 5/7 (since it would sum up to all) of the fruits are apples because 1 - 2/7 = 5/7. Each fifth part represents one apple since every fruit is either an apple or a pear. Since we need to find out what 1 whole part equals, we can set up the equation: 5 parts / 5 = 1 apple per part * X. This means if 84 pears are 2/7 of the total, then each 'part' consists of half as many objects as there are pears. Half of 84 is 42. Therefore, we multiply this value by 5 to get our total number of apples: 42 * 5 = 210.

The problem tells us that 2/7 of the fruits are pears, so if we set up a proportion, we can find out what part of the whole is made up of apples (the remaining fraction).

To find out the full amount of fruit (both apples and pears), we divide the number of pears by their fractional representation: 84 / (2/7) = 84 * (7/2) = 294. This is the total number of both types of fruit. Because 5/7 of these fruits are apples, we multiply 294 by 5/7 to find the number of apples: 294 * (5/7) = 210.
