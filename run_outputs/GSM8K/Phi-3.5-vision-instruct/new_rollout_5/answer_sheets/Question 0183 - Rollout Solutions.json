The original mixture was 40% sugar which means there were 0.4 * 150 g = 60 g of sugar in the initial mixture.

There was initially 0.4 * 150g = 60g of sugar. Removing 30g of the mixture removes about half of this amount because 0.4 * 30g equals 12g which is one quarter of the initial amount. Thus, removing 30g of mixture leaves us with approximately 48g (60g - 12g) of sugar. Adding 30g of pure sugar increases the amount back up to 78g (48g + 30g). Divide this sum by the current weight of the mixture (which remains 150g), getting 78/150 or roughly 0.52. Multiplying by 100 gets you to around 52%.
