We know that the formula for calculating simple interest is `I = PRT`, where P represents principal (the initial amount of money), R is the rate of interest per year expressed as a decimal, and T is time in years. Here, we need to find out how much interest was earned when $600 was invested at 10% simple interest for 4 years. Using this information, let's calculate it step by step. Firstly, convert the percentage into a decimal which would result in 10/100 or simply 0.10. Next plug these values into our equation `I = PRT`. Substituting the known values: `I = 600 * 0.10 * 4`. Multiplying these together, 600 * 0.10 equals 60, and multiplying that product by 4 yields 240.
