We start with the hint provided. We can rewrite it as (Total Fruit) * (3/8) = 60. To find out how many fruits there are in total, we need to isolate Total Fruit.

We know that the bananas make up (1 - 3/8) of the fruit basket because apples are 3/8. So, the rest of the fruits are 5/8. Since we know there are 60 bananas which represent 5/8 of the total fruit basket, we can find out what represents one part by dividing 60 by 5. That means, 1 part equals 60 / 5 = 12. To get all parts combined, since 1 part is equal to 12, we multiply this value by 8, as there are 8 parts in whole (since 1/8 + 7/8 makes 8/8). Thus, 12 multiplied by 8 equals 96.
