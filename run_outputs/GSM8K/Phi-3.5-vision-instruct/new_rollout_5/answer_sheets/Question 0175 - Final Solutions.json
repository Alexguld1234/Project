Thus, by the end of the first year, we see that the phone\u2019s value decreases to: $600 - $120 = $480.\n\nIn the next year i.e., the second year, the phone experiences another round of depreciation but only by 10%. This time around, we need to take away 10% or 0.10 times the current cost($480): 0.10 * $480 = $48.
