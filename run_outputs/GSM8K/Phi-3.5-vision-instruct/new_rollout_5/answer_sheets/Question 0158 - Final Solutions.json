This means that the ratio of apples to bananas is 3:5. If we let the common factor be 'x', then 3x represents the number of apples and 5x represents the total number of fruits. Since we know there are 60 bananas (which corresponds to '5x'), we can find out what one unit ('x') is equal to by dividing 60 by 5. One unit ('x') equals 12. Therefore, the total number of fruits (5x) would be 5 times 12, which equals 60. However, this doesn't seem right because it suggests there are only bananas and no apples. Let's rethink our approach considering both apples and bananas together. If 3 parts are apples and 5 parts are bananas, making 8 parts in total, and knowing that 5 parts correspond to 60 bananas, we can calculate the value of one part first. Each part is worth 60 divided by 5, so one part is 12. Since there are 8 parts in total, the total number of fruits would be 12 multiplied by 8, which equals 96.
