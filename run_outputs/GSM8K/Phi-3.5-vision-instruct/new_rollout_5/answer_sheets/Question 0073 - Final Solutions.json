Therefore, if running 300 meters takes 60 seconds, then covering twice that distance in the same amount of time (double both) still requires 60 seconds. Since the runner covers 5 meters per second consistently, doubling the time won't change the distance covered; thus, no matter what speed we consider here due to the direct proportionality, the answer comes down to 300 meters multiplied by 2 which equals 600 meters.
