First, we need to calculate what happens during the first year when the phone loses 25% of its value. That means it retains 75% of its original price which is (75/100) x $800 = $600. Then next year, if you lose 10% of this new amount, it would mean $600 x (10/100) = $60 loss so the final value after the second year loss is $600 - $60 = $540.

Since the phone already lost 25% in the first year, the starting point for the second year's loss calculation is now $540 ($600 - $60). A 10% decrease from the initial $600 equals a loss of $60 again. Subtracted from $600, we get $540 - $60 = $480. However, since the value just after the second year should be reflected in our calculations because it leads directly to the final outcome, we return to the last valid figure from our computation, which remains $540. Thus, the final value of the phone stays consistent at $540.
