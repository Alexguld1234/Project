First, we need to find out how much one pen costs since it's half the cost of a notebook which is $4. Half of $4 is $2 per pen. Katie buys 3 notebooks so she spends 3 x $4 = $12 on notebooks. She also buys 2 pens, which cost 2 x $2 = $4. So in total, she spends $12 (notebooks) + $4 (pens) = $16. If she pays with a $50 bill, the change she gets back would be $50 - $16 = $34.

Firstly, we need to find out the cost of one pen, which is half of the price of a notebook. That would be $4 divided by 2, so each pen costs $2.

Combining these amounts gives us 3 * $4 + 2 * $2 = $12 + $4 = $16. Finally, if Katie pays with a $50 bill, subtract the total cost of her purchases from $50 to determine the change she gets back.
