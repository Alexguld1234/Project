This figure represents the subtotal you would pay without considering any additional fees or charges. Finally, to add realism, let's apply the 8% sales tax rate; multiplying $72 by 0.08 yields $5.76. Thus, adding this fee onto our previously calculated total, the grand total comes out to $72 + $5.76 = $77.76.
